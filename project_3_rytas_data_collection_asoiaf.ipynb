       "   'selftext': 'After seven long months, I have finally caught up with the books, hoping to wash out the awful taste of Season 8 from my mouth and receive a better ending from George RR Martin himself. Overall, I can definitely say it\\'s a great series (of course it is, otherwise how would it have held my attention for five gigantic tomes?). BUT.....A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons put a bit of a damper on what was a fantastic original trilogy with Thrones, Kings, and Swords. Let me be clear that I don\\'t think either are bad books; on the contrary, both are still good, I\\'d probably give Feast a 4/5 and Dance a 4/5 as well (might turn into a 3.5/5 later one, we\\'ll see).\\n\\nDance in particular is just so frustrating to me because there\\'s so much good here that George has written, but I can\\'t help but feel that he\\'s just gotten....I don\\'t know, distracted? Trying too hard to make his story as epic as possible and just adding too many POVs in the process? Let me explain.\\n\\n* First, what I liked: the worldbuilding is really good in this book in particular. Volantis, the Rhoyne, Meereen, and Braavos really come to life in this entry with unique customs and culture (I found the commentary on moral relativism with the Ghiscaris particularly interesting).\\n* The twin stars of Jon and Daenerys really carry the book and keep me slogging through the side characters (more on that later). It\\'s with these two that the most \"action\" actually happens. Theon is also a particular standout (the image of Reek eating a rat will always stick with me), as well as Davos in the earlier parts of the book, but goddamn if I didn\\'t hope that man got more chapters. I feel like George has criminally underutilized Davos in every book, despite him apparently being one of the more popular POVs. \\n* This book really made me fall in love with Daenerys after not being a huge fan of her in the first three books (her book two plotline where she did jack shit in Qarth was just the worst), making her a real character for me as she struggled to balance her compassion with the troubles of ruling. Jon simply continued his course as perhaps the best-written character in this entire series as he navigates Stannis\\'s posse on one side and his own sworn brothers on the other (Jon\\'s death was very interesting here especially compared to how the show did it, him riling up a wildling army was seriously badass). Tyrion was also a very engaging character to read, he made me laugh out loud quite a few times even if I\\'m not really sure where his story is going; he\\'s just kinda like the funny dwarf who does stuff. Tyrion\\'s whole plot in this book, though interesting while I\\'m actually reading it, just ends up feeling a little pointless. Did we really need to read three hundred pages of Tyrion traveling on the Rhoyne?\\n* Okay, on to the meh stuff: I\\'m sorry but I just cannot get into some of these goddamn side characters and subplots. Quentyn Martell is a complete waste of space. I really don\\'t care if he\\'s supposed to be a \"clever subversion of the traditional hero\\'s journey.\" George has already done plenty of hero subverting with both Eddard and Robb, he really didn\\'t have to do it a third time. Editing, George, it exists!\\n* I\\'m trying my hardest, but I just cannot get into the Aegon plotline. like come on George, how do you expect us to care about this character that you\\'re literally introducing in the fifth book? I\\'ve heard he\\'s meant to be a foil to Daenerys, which honestly would make his character even worse because then he\\'s just a plot device for Dany to go mad or something. While I didn\\'t hate either Quentyn\\'s or Connington\\'s POVs while I was reading them (because George is still a great writer), afterwards I was just left with confusion and \"why the hell does this matter.\" The epilogue is intriguing but Varys\\'s surprise appearance was so ridiculous it felt like I was back in Season 8, and again Aegon is just not an interesting character. The Prince is really rather annoying. \\n* The only \"unnamed\" POVs that actually peeked my interest were Victarion just because of how much of an asshole he is (that two gods stuff is epic af) and Barristan cuz he\\'s Barristan (\"No, we will shatter them\" was definitely the most epic line in this book, even if I\\'m annoyed his chapter ended on a stupid cliffhanger).\\n* THIS BOOK RESOLVES NOTHING. Now I understand why long time fans have been dying since 2011. George left this damn book with like five cliffhangers. Tyrion literally spends the last third of the book trapped in the stupid fucking Yunkai camp, and never even meets Daenerys even though that\\'s what his entire goddamn journey is about. Like, really George? I\\'m super glad the show changed this and at least got Tyrion and Daenerys to meet Season 5, cuz the lack of closure really would have cock-blocked the fanbase even harder. But yeah, I have no idea how George is gonna resolve these massive plotlines in two books. Things better ramp up quickly.\\n* Jaime should have had at least another chapter. Again, too many damn cliffhangers.\\n\\nI read this interesting [review](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/book-review-dance-dragons/) from Mother Jones that basically highlights all my major issues with the book, underlining that the editing (or lack thereof) is perhaps the biggest problem. After finishing this, I can\\'t help but agree, and I just feel that Feast and Dance really had no business being separate books. They very easily could have been one book with proper cuts (those cuts being the majority of the Dorne characters. Sorry!).\\n\\nTL;DR I didn\\'t hate this book, but I didn\\'t completely love it either. Just my opinion, don\\'t kill me please.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn a recent NotACast episode on [A Clash of Kings Catelyn II](https://notacastasoiaf.podbean.com/e/episode-94-a-clash-of-kings-catelyn-ii-summer-knights-ft-special-guest-lady-gwynhyfvar-from-radio-westeros/), Emmett and Jeff talk about how Dany and Stannis\\' stories have parallels to each other. And indeed they do. However, their discussion got me thinking, and I believe that there are actually more similarities between Dany and Renly\\'s stories than there are between Dany and Stannis\\'. The following table lists many of these similarities, and builds on [my theory about how the War of the Five Kings will repeat itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dccah9/spoilers_extended_the_war_of_the_five_kings_will/). Overall, while Dany is certainly a better and more sympathetic version of Renly, she is also a more dangerous version given her possession of three fire-breathing weapons of mass destruction.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n|**Renly**|**Dany**|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Legally second in line to the throne behind Stannis (assuming the Baratheons are considered the true kings).

But the last Targaryen ruler–Aerys–was a terrible king and dragons posed a threat to all of the realm.

It would send the message that might makes right.|Dany becoming queen would be destabilizing for Westeros because it would negate the principle that the oldest son/brother of the \\\\*current\\\\* king is the successor and therefore legitimize other attempts to overthrow the current ruling family.

Jon Snow/Targaryen.|\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Conclusion: What This Says About Dany**\\n\\nGeorge R.R. Martin certainly wants us to sympathize with Dany. She starts the story being forced to marry Khal Drogo against her will, is the target of assassination plots at age 13, and goes on a righteous campaign in Essos to free slaves. However, while Dany\\'s \"mhysa,\" or mother, side makes her sympathetic, her fire and blood side and possession of dragons poses a dire threat to the people of Essos and Westeros. Dany\\'s ascension to power in Westeros and the restoration of Targaryen rule would be a step back for Westeros; not a step forward. It is in this fundamental way that Dany\\'s story parallels Renly\\'s. Just as Renly\\'s attempt to usurp his brother Stannis was destabilizing for Westeros, so is Dany\\'s planned conquest of Westeros with dragons. Ultimately, Renly is killed because he is a threat to the realm, and that is why Dany will ultimately be killed as well.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'In Feast and Dance, the kindly man constantly drives home to Arya that they serve the many faced god, and that they don’t have the power to choose death themselves. I’m about finished with my Dance reread, and in one of the recent Arya chapters the kindly man specifically mentions how they essentially don’t care about money, and that the will of the MFG is what’s most important. \\n\\nI can’t remember if it’s said in the book or just the show, but in the first book/season when the small council is discussing assassinating Daenerys, Littlefinger remarks about how expensive they are to hire. If this is the show, then we can just ignore it but I’m pretty sure it’s mentioned in the book. If they don’t care about money, then why charge so much? \\n\\nAnd even if they don’t charge money, how exactly are targets chosen? The kindly man says it’s the MFG who chooses, but to my understanding, people basically just come to the House of Black and White and ask for someone to be assassinated. I felt like this was implied when Arya assassinates the man at the harbor by giving him the poisoned coin. How is that any different from one of them choosing to assassinate someone themselves? \\n\\nI’m sure I’ve just missed something, but if it’s never been spelled out more explicitly then I’m interested to see what people think.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'GRRM has given us a little bits and pieces about the future of Dunk and Egg. I recently posted about the [She-Wolves of Winterfell](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eqisf1/what_we_know_the_she_wolves_of_winterfell/) and I thought it would be fun to speculate as to where their story is headed from here.\\n\\nI got this idea from a post/comment that was shared with me awhile back. I know we spoke back then, but if this is your work, please let me know as I would love to cite you. \\n\\n**I thought it would be fun to dive deeper into the potential possibilities for future Dunk &amp; Egg stories.**\\n\\n***\\n\\n#SSM Info \\n\\n**Varying Number of Total Novellas**\\n\\n&gt;**GRRM:** ...there will be more Dunk &amp; Eggs.  Four does not tell the entire story.  **I want to take these two characters through their entire lives and that will probably require, I don’t know, eight, nine, ten, twelve novellas.**  Written over the years, I sort of slipped them in between the books so it’ll take me a while.  But, you know, that’s more Westeros material.  As to what I’m going to write after that, I really don’t know.  That’s so many years in the future…whatever I said now, I would probably change my mind whenever I reached it anyway. -[SSM: Interview with GRRM Part I: 12 July 2011](https://www.webcitation.org/66fwa9nw4)\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;Turning back to prose, however... it has always been my intent to write a whole series of novellas about Dunk and Egg, chronicling their entire lives.  **At various times in various interviews I may have mentioned seven novellas, or ten, or twelve, but none of that is set in stone.**  There will be as many novellas as it takes to tell their tale, start to finish. [-SSM, Dunk and Egg: 15 April 2014](https://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html)\\n\\n**Current idea seems to be to publish them in sets of 3**\\n\\n&gt;&gt;My original intent was to publish all the Dunk &amp; Egg stories in a series of anthologies, and then collect them all together in one big book.  But by the time of \"The Mystery Knight,\" it became plain that the stories were just too long, and there were going to be too many of them.  **So instead of one big book, the plan now is for a series of Dunk &amp; Egg collections, each comprised of three novellas.**  The first one to consist of the three published stories, \"The Hedge Knight,\" \"The Sworn Sword,\" and \"The Mystery Knight.\"   The obvious title would have been THE HEDGE KNIGHT, but there is already a certain amount of confusion between \"The Hedge Knight\" the novella and THE HEDGE KNIGHT the graphic novel, and we did not want to compound the difficulty, so the first Dunk &amp; Egg collection was titled A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS instead.  [-SSM, Dunk and Egg: 15 April 2014](https://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html)\\n\\n**Dunk &amp; Egg TV/Movie Future**\\n\\n&gt;I am frequently asked whether or not there are any plans for Dunk &amp; Egg movies or television shows.  There has been interest, yes, but the rights situation is complicated.  Film and television rights to the characters and the three published Dunk &amp; Egg stories remain with me at present... but HBO, when acquiring the rights to the SONG OF ICE &amp; FIRE novels, also acquired film and television rights to the world of Westeros.  So if we did Dunk &amp; Egg with anyone else, we would need to remove all the references to House Targaryen, the Iron Throne, etc... not completely impossible, but certainly undesireable.  Whereas if HBO decided they wanted to make a Dunk &amp; Egg miniseries or TV movies, they\\'d first need to buy the stories.  That\\'s a much more attractive proposition for all concerned, I think... but if it happens, it will happen years from now, not tomorrow, and not next week.  [-SSM, Dunk and Egg: 15 April 2014](https://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html)\\n\\n**Possible Future Novellas**\\n\\n&gt;But I do have notes and fairly specific ideas for a number of them. There\\'s the one set in the north that people have been calling **\"The She-Wolves of Winterfell,\" though that will not actually be the title. After that -- or maybe before, if I jump around in time -- there will be \"The Village Hero,\" \"The Sellsword,\" \"The Champion,\" \"The Kingsguard,\" \"The Lord Commander,\" and several more in between.** -[SSM, How Many Seasons: 19 March 2015](https://grrm.livejournal.com/412015.html?thread=20463983#t20463983)\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;The unfinished novella was indeed set in Winterfell, and involved a group of formidable Stark wives, widows, mothers, and grandmothers that I dubbed \\'the She-Wolves,\\' but \"The She-Wolves of Winterfell\" was never meant to be more than a working title.  The final title, when I finish the story, will be something different.  **There\\'s also another Dunk &amp; Egg novella that I\\'ve got roughed out in my head, with the working title \"The Village Hero.\"**  That one takes place in the Riverlands.   There\\'s no telling when I will have time to finish either of these, or which one I will write first.  I don\\'t expect I will know more until I\\'ve delivered THE WINDS OF WINTER.  [-SSM, Dunk and Egg: 15 April 2014](https://grrm.livejournal.com/365715.html)\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;I asked GRRM about the curious response he gave to someone once, as reported in this report regarding whether Duncan the Small or Jaehaerys had been heir to King Aegon V (Egg).\\n\\n&gt;He intends to keep that vague, because it\\'s supposed to be a revelation for future Dunk &amp; Egg stories.\\n\\n&gt;Zollo asked George whether he would continue with the naming pattern that he has used for the first two Dunk &amp; Egg stories, essentially titling them after what stage Duncan is in his career. At one point I mentioned that the last could just be called \"Summerhall\".\\n\\n&gt;**He said he was considering it, and might well do so if he could come up with good titles in that mode and they actually fit with the story. When I fished with that suggestion for the last Dunk &amp; Egg story, I believe -- but cannot verify -- that George gave me a curious look. It may be that I hit close to the mark, or it could just be my imagination.

       "   'selftext': 'Hello,\\n\\nAfter [Dany\\'s Dream](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/euovm0/danys_dream_fire_and_blood_spoiler_main/), this time I have another breakdown about Dany. I can say that is connected with Dany\\'s Dream thread.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Jhogo spied it first. \"There,\" he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\\'s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign.\\n\\nThis star was interpreted by most as a dragon. Probably came to sign the birth of the dragons and also the birth of AA.\\n\\nBefore that, the part between Dany and Mirri was interesting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo\\'s pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman\\'s head herself. \"I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,\" she said, \"for the lessons you have taught me.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"You will not hear me scream,\" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I will,\" Dany said, \"but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.\" Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, **Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi\\'s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear**. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.\\n\\nWhen they pour the oil on the woman, Mirri knows that she will burn her to death, but she is not afraid and says, \"I will not scream,\" she says that she will not let her enjoy her, but she starts to be afraid and worried when Dany response to her .\\n\\nShe just knew how to die and was not afraid, why should did she be scared now when Dany challenges? I think Mirri understood what Dany was trying to do, and that scared her because if you remember, she had said that Dany\\'s son had to die, because he would be the stallion to sit on top of the world and burn it all over. I mean, I guess Mirri understood that dragons would be born.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. **She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had **danced at her wedding,** whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. *Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing.* **This is a wedding, too, she thought**. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn.\\n\\nThis funeral is a **wedding** for Dany. Dany\\'s dragon\\'s blood and the fire is in her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. **The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen,** each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. **She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last.** She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now.\\n\\nSelys came to my mind when Dany looked at the fire with such admiration. Jon said that the woman looked at the fire with love, and if Melisandre wanted it, she seemed to be throwing herself in the arms of the fire. In fact, it is not surprising for those who worship the fire. Maybe she doesn\\'t know yet, but Dany is now the follower of R’hllor. But I have to say that there is more to be than a follower. I will touch on the next parts, Dany hinted above, actually.\\n\\nDescriptions of Dany\\'s body sweating are as if reminiscent of a wedding night (or giving birth).\\n\\nFlame images resembling animals ... I have no other interpretation other than the one that everyone knows.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, **her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples**. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing.\\n\\nYes, this milk was due to being pregnant. In spite of this, in the funeral fire (Drogo is gone) milk starts flowing from her breast just before the first egg cracks. First Dany said \"wedding,\" then she started sweating like a wedding night and giving birth and now milk?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;She heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, **pale and veined with gold**, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.\\n\\nThe first egg was cracked and the first baby was born; At the feet of Dany\\'s feet, the first cry is a roar. Viserion has born. Yes, he is big brother. :D\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Only death can pay for life.\\n\\nProbably Egg tried to do this in Sumerhall but failed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. **The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\\'t you see? Don\\'t you SEE?** With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, **Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her children.**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world.\\n\\nHere is my favorite part…  BRIDE OF THE DRAGONS, DAUGHTER OF DRAGONS , MOTHER OF THE DRAGONS… Dany CALLED HER CHILDREN.\\n\\nNow we have come to the most interesting part. Maybe you agree or disagree with what I say but everything that happened to me was Dany\\'s journey to meet with **the fire.**\\n\\nIt will sound strange to some, but Dany is married to **R’hllor (the fire**) here. This was a wedding. It is also a wedding night. It\\'s also a moment of pregnancy and birth. Everything that has happened contains elements that meet what I said. Special-important days for Dothraks are held under the night sky, and all this happened on a truly special night; as soon as the comet appears first…\\n\\nFirst of all, the giant winged dragon that sets fire around in Dany\\'s Dream represents R\\'hllor for me. I do not know, but we are talking about a god who is depicted so much by fire. And the details of the king titles and eye colors of those people we think of as Dany\\'s ancestors indicate that these people lived during the Dawn Empire, right? ( At least we know that there is no \"king\" title in Valyria, and we saw those strange eye colors mentioned earlier in the Dawn Empire.) Tell me, was it ridiculous that R’hllor was a dragon? Not a real winged one, but a dragon lord with great magic powers…\\n\\nR’hllor burned Dany\\'s husband, son and little world into ash. He did what it needed for Dany to transform and evolve, awakened the dragon inside her, and of course he had warnings. He saved her from the paws of death. He also taught what to do.\\n\\nThere are two remarkable details at Drogo\\'s funeral. When the funeral night came, a comet was in the sky, representing \"dragons\". And according to the Dothrak tradition, all the important things happen at night, under the starry sky. Because of this thought, Dany took out Drogo, made love and got pregnant.\\n\\nNow Dany lit the fire and entered. What did she say?\\n\\n&gt;*Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing.* **This is a wedding, too, she thought**.\\n\\nDany hugs her new husband. “It\\'s a wedding,” he said. Who is the wedding with? Who are you getting married to? Fire. With R’hllor. The redness and sweat on his skin metaphorically also represent the night of marriage and the moment of birth. He eventually got married on fire and got into the bed of marriage.\\n\\nWhat is said and happened afterwards proves that this is a wedding and a wedding night with the fire(metaphorically).\\n\\n**Daughter of Dragons**:  Her ancestors (parents) were dragons, of course she is daughter of that dragons.\\n\\n**Bride of Dragons**: What dragon did she marry? Another sign that R’hllor is a dragon?\\n\\n**Mother of Dragons**: Her children are dragons. Dragon parents/ancestors , dragon husband and dragon children.\\n\\nYes, Dany married the fire and had 3 children from her new husband. It is normal that a child does not come to life in her belly. Thanks to her husband, he does not allow. This is a joke, but it has a serious share. A child can divert Dany from her purpose, and nd I don\\'t think R’hllor, who has plans for her, will allow it.\\n\\nLet\\'s add another quote to you, from Undying Ones. This time, this sentence will be more meaningful to you, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;. . . mother of dragons, **bride of fire** . . .\\n\\nLook, here again, there was a description of a fire and a bride. Who is the fire? R’hllor.\\n\\nThe interpretation turns out to be true or not, but I liked to think in this way and was excited when I first noticed it.\\n\\nThe breakdown ends here, as always, I welcome your ideas.

       "   'selftext': 'Hello,\\n\\nAfter [Dany\\'s Dream](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/euovm0/danys_dream_fire_and_blood_spoiler_main/), this time I have another breakdown about Dany. I can say that is connected with Dany\\'s Dream thread.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Jhogo spied it first. \"There,\" he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\\'s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign. \\n\\nThis star was interpreted by most as a dragon. Probably came to sign the birth of the dragons and also the birth of AA.\\n\\nBefore that, the part between Dany and Mirri was interesting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo\\'s pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman\\'s head herself. \"I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,\" she said, \"for the lessons you have taught me.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"You will not hear me scream,\" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I will,\" Dany said, \"but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.\" Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, **Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi\\'s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear**. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.\\n\\nWhen they pour the oil on the woman, Mirri knows that she will burn her to death, but she is not afraid and says, \"I will not scream,\" she says that she will not let her enjoy her, but she starts to be afraid and worried when Dany response to her . \\n\\nShe just knew how to die and was not afraid, why should did she be scared now when Dany challenges? I think Mirri understood what Dany was trying to do, and that scared her because if you remember, she had said that Dany\\'s son had to die, because he would be the stallion to sit on top of the world and burn it all over. I mean, I guess Mirri understood that dragons would be born.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. **She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.**   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had **danced at her wedding,** whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. *Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing.* **This is a wedding, too, she thought**. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn. \\n\\nThis funeral is a **wedding** for Dany. Dany\\'s dragon\\'s blood and the fire is in her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. **The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen,** each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. **She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last.** She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now. \\n\\nSelys came to my mind when Dany looked at the fire with such admiration. Jon said that the woman looked at the fire with love, and if Melisandre wanted it, she seemed to be throwing herself in the arms of the fire. In fact, it is not surprising for those who worship the fire. Maybe she doesn\\'t know yet, but Dany is now the follower of R’hllor. But I have to say that there is more to be than a follower. I will touch on the next parts, Dany hinted above, actually.\\n\\nDescriptions of Dany\\'s body sweating are as if reminiscent of a wedding night (or giving birth).\\n\\nFlame images resembling animals ... I have no other interpretation other than the one that everyone knows. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, **her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples**. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing. \\n\\nYes, this milk was due to being pregnant. In spite of this, in the funeral fire (Drogo is gone) milk starts flowing from her breast just before the first egg cracks. First Dany said \"wedding,\" then she started sweating like a wedding night and giving birth and now milk?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; She heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, **pale and veined with gold**, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder. \\n\\nThe first egg was cracked and the first baby was born; At the feet of Dany\\'s feet, the first cry is a roar. Viserion has born. Yes, he is big brother. :D \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Only death can pay for life.\\n\\nProbably Egg tried to do this in Sumerhall but failed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. **The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\\'t you see? Don\\'t you SEE?** With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, **Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her children.**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world.\\n\\nHere is my favorite part…  BRIDE OF THE DRAGONS, DAUGHTER OF DRAGONS , MOTHER OF THE DRAGONS… Dany CALLED HER CHILDREN.\\n\\nNow we have come to the most interesting part. Maybe you agree or disagree with what I say but everything that happened to me was Dany\\'s journey to meet with **the fire.**\\n\\nIt will sound strange to some, but Dany is married to **R’hllor (the fire**) here. This was a wedding. It is also a wedding night. It\\'s also a moment of pregnancy and birth. Everything that has happened contains elements that meet what I said. Special-important days for Dothraks are held under the night sky, and all this happened on a truly special night; as soon as the comet appears first…\\n\\nFirst of all, the giant winged dragon that sets fire around in Dany\\'s Dream represents R\\'hllor for me. I do not know, but we are talking about a god who is depicted so much by fire. And the details of the king titles and eye colors of those people we think of as Dany\\'s ancestors indicate that these people lived during the Dawn Empire, right? ( At least we know that there is no \"king\" title in Valyria, and we saw those strange eye colors mentioned earlier in the Dawn Empire.) Tell me, was it ridiculous that R’hllor was a dragon? Not a real winged one, but a dragon lord with great magic powers…\\n\\nR’hllor burned Dany\\'s husband, son and little world into ash. He did what it needed for Dany to transform and evolve, awakened the dragon inside her, and of course he had warnings. He saved her from the paws of death. He also taught what to do.\\n\\nThere are two remarkable details at Drogo\\'s funeral. When the funeral night came, a comet was in the sky, representing \"dragons\". And according to the Dothrak tradition, all the important things happen at night, under the starry sky. Because of this thought, Dany took out Drogo, made love and got pregnant.\\n\\nNow Dany lit the fire and entered. What did she say?\\n\\n&gt;*Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing.* **This is a wedding, too, she thought**.\\n\\nDany hugs her new husband. “It\\'s a wedding,” he said. Who is the wedding with? Who are you getting married to? Fire. With R’hllor. The redness and sweat on his skin metaphorically also represent the night of marriage and the moment of birth. He eventually got married on fire and got into the bed of marriage.\\n\\nWhat is said and happened afterwards proves that this is a wedding and a wedding night with the fire(metaphorically).\\n\\n**Daughter of Dragons**:  Her ancestors (parents) were dragons, of course she is daughter of that dragons.\\n\\n**Bride of Dragons**: What dragon did she marry? Another sign that R’hllor is a dragon?\\n\\n**Mother of Dragons**: Her children are dragons. Dragon parents/ancestors , dragon husband and dragon children.\\n\\nYes, Dany married the fire and had 3 children from her new husband. It is normal that a child does not come to life in her belly. Thanks to her husband, he does not allow. This is a joke, but it has a serious share. A child can divert Dany from her purpose, and nd I don\\'t think R’hllor, who has plans for her, will allow it.\\n\\nLet\\'s add another quote to you, from Undying Ones. This time, this sentence will be more meaningful to you, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; . . . mother of dragons, **bride of fire** . . . \\n\\nLook, here again, there was a description of a fire and a bride. Who is the fire? R’hllor.\\n\\nThe interpretation turns out to be true or not, but I liked to think in this way and was excited when I first noticed it.\\n\\nThe breakdown ends here, as always, I welcome your ideas. Thank you for read.',\n",

Ned invokes loyalty unlike few else...i explain this poorly if you want you can read the great Northern Conspiracy parts1-7 + footnotes i\\'ll leave a link\\n\\nThe point is Ned\\'s legacy won.\\n\\nI dont think that the reveal will be useless and no heros or chosen ones exist in Asoiaf\\n\\nWhy build up such a great and big reveal ? And R+L=J is like 95% guaranteed to be true\\nAnd GRRM has said this .....\\nhttps://youtu.be/Fyw-K58Ve68\\n\\nSo i think while it not may be LOUD it may be Epic \\n\\n\\nBy Epic I mean something like this....\\nThis is my dream reveal \\nThis is an Indian 2 part fantasy sort of Film  ( I am Indian )\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/f95ltH_LaB8\\n\\n\\nAnd its amazing This is the first part with English subtitles I posted here go to time stamp 1:30:52 to see the reveal but that\\'s only a part of it \\nThe whole film till now builds upto the reveal and is very mysterious so if you want to know the complete story i suggest you start it from the beginning and no spoilers but this has one of the greatest Cliffhanger endings.....\\n\\n\\n Or read the summary from Wikipedia i guess\\nYou won\\'t regret it....Also I am curious how many of you here are also from India ?\\n\\n\\nAlso while Kit Harrington is a great actor and no offence to him or any of his fans but i never saw him as Jon ....like the show writing made him Stupider than Hodor ( no offence again ! )\\nJon was a talented commander an able warrior and One of the best players of the Game\\nStannis would have been dead if he did not follow Jon\\'s advice and went to Karhold instead of The mountain clans and drove of the Iron born \\n\\nHe chose to give up lordships and legitimisation, and his Struggle with Idealism and Vows reminds me of Ned\\nHe invokes Loyalty and love and respect like Ned and Rhaegar \\nAlso I always imagined his face to be somewhat roughcut like Eddard but yet sleek and somewhat angular and clean shaven ( its described as such in the books ) like Rhaegar and the Pic I posted as the header in this post is the best representation of Jon\\nSorry but Kit\\'s face is too round again sorry!\\n\\nWhat sort of reveal do you have in mind ?',\n",

Soon comes the* *pale mare, and after her the others.* *Kraken* *and* *dark flame,* *lion* *and* *griffin,* *the sun's son* *and the* *mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the* *Undying. Beware the* *perfumed seneschal.*\\n\\nwhen I read it first, I thought the *sun's son* is Quentyn and *mummer's dragon* is Aegon but after re-reading, I have a different opinion. see how each group is mentioned.\\n\\nVictorian and Moqorro started their journey separately but ended on the same ship. Tyrion and Jon Con started their journey together but separated from the same ship.\\n\\nBut If *mummer's dragon* is Aegon and *sun's son* is Quentyn then it's odd that they are mentioned as a team. Both don't even know each other. Shouldn't the sentence should be *griffin and the mummer's dragon*.\\n\\nIn *the sun's son, the* sun of house Martell represent nymeria, this house gives importance to female, the sun represents the women of the house. The head of the house Martell before Doran was his mother. And Doran has a master plan and secretly doing moves via proxies and has placed his pieces in important locations. Doran fits the vision better than Quentyn.\\n\\nOne of the commenters pointed out this\\n\\n&gt;In the throne room of sun spear, there are two thrones: one with a sun (representing Nymeria and the Roynish) and one with a spear (representing House Martell). Doran sits on the throne with the spear. It is possible that the spear is intended for male rulers and the sun is intended for female rulers. If that's the case then Doran being the sun's son is more fitting than Quentin.\\n\\nIn *the* *mummer's dragon,* it means fake dragon but Aegon is not fake if he is a blackfyre it makes him a black dragon. as Illyrio said **Black or Red a dragon is still a dragon.** Yes, the mummer represents varys, he once traveled with mummers and also disguised himself and played different characters. But my question holds the same, Doran/Quentyn and Varys/Aegon stand against each other's interest, they are more enemies than rivals.\\n\\nThen who is the fake dragon? well, it's Quentyn, He is a Rhoynar but claims he can control dragons due to his one Targaryen ancestor. Lied to Daenerys with a fake marriage pact signed by two dead men, both have no authority to make a marriage alliance. His true purpose is to get the dragons. He is truly fake. His loyalty is fake.\\n\\n*the sun's son* *and the* *mummer's dragon* are Doran and Quentyn.\",\n",

Cattle like chicken is definitely an option since you can continuously get eggs from them (even though the rate at which you get eggs is lower compared to in summer) without needing to slaughter them but I find it hard to believe that that alone could sustain an entire portion of the continent.\\n\\nSo how do people from the North survive?

       "   'selftext': '... burn Lysa’s letter in “a game of thrones” \\n\\nI’ve always wondered what really were the contents of Lysa’s letter that frightens Cat in to burning the letter. \\n\\nWhat we know for sure:\\n\\n1. It was delivered hidden in a false bottom in a box\\n2. It was written in a made up language that only her and Lysa understood \\n3. She doesn’t read the letter in full at all out loud. She paraphrases and explains what the letter was about. \\n4. She then burns the letter and defends her burning the letter that it would implicate Lysa if it was ever read. \\n\\nNote that that the only way for it to be read is if Winterfel is sacked which is highly unlikely to almost impossible at this point in the story; or if someone broke in to where Maester Luwin keeps them on record. I would assume in a secure part of the library or his own “office” or a secured area of the rookery.\\n\\nSo why did she actually burn it? I find it hard to believe that she was only protecting her sister and family from someone else seeing it. What was actually in the letter? \\n\\nI understand that a language made up by children wouldn’t be some secret code that no one could crack. I’m sure a maester would be able to figure it out eventually or even in a short amount of time, but as I pointed out earlier, the odds of that happening other than Luwin reading it... they are slim to none. So what was she hiding? \\n\\nWas it as simple as it’s written and am I reading in to it too much because of my very large dislike for Catelyn and every horrible decision she makes? \\n\\nThanks for your opinions in advance.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Anyone who\\'s spent any time in this sub or any ASOIAF/GoT forum knows about the debate regarding who Azor Ahai, or the Prince that was Promised, or Hyrkoon the Hero or Eldric Shadowchaser is. Popular consensus seems to be Jon, or Dany, but there are lots of possibilities, from Rhaegar to Jaime to Hot Pie. \\n\\nThe reason for this is because so many of the aspects of the prophecy could easily be metaphorical; so many aspects of anyone\\'s life can be twisted to fit the prophecy. Everyone has a different savior they want to worship. Melisandre thinks it\\'s Stannis, the Volantenes and Dothraki think it\\'s Dany, the fans think it\\'s Jon, some even think it\\'s Rhaegar. All of these characters fit the prophecy to some extent, and any missing pieces can simply be waved away by saying, \"They haven\\'t done it yet, but they will\". So the point is...\\n\\n**TL;DR: The true Azor Ahai  will never be confirmed; instead, characters within the story will be seen as Azor Ahai, and their followers will do great evil in the name of their chosen savior. This is part of the story\\'s theme of the dangers of fanaticism.**\\n\\nSAVIOR ONE: RHAEGAR\\n\\nI think an important part of ASOIAF that\\'s sometimes overlooked is how people constantly do terrible things in order to fulfill the Azor Ahai prophecy. It starts with Rhaegar, who thought Jon would be the prince that was promised. He runs off with Lyanna to birth the third head of the dragon and/or the chosen savior because of her special bloodline, and in the process starts a massive war that causes the deaths of his wife and children, not to mention thousands of soldiers. Some good does come out of this, though; Jon is born, and perhaps he will indeed save the world, destroy the darkness, etc. Say he does all of this after his resurrection--is it worth all the death and war? I think George would say no, because of the Stannis story.\\n\\nSAVIOR TWO: STANNIS\\n\\nIn ASOS, Stannis is urged on by Mel and her followers to burn Edric Storm, his bastard nephew, alive in order to fulfill the prophecy and \"wake dragons from stone\". Davos believes this would be pure evil, but Stannis is tempted because he thinks it necessary to save the world.\\n\\n&gt;He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm.\" His hand swept across the Painted Table. \"How many boys dwell in Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. She talks of prophecies . . . a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone . . . she speaks of signs and swears they point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king...what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Everything,\" said Davos, softly.\\n\\nThe question here is whether the \"greater good\" of fulfilling prophecy is worth the murder of innocents, and Davos gives us the answer: of course it\\'s not! And I think the story\\'s message is clear that murdering a teenager because *maybe* it will birth dragons is an evil thing to do. But Stannis is doing exactly what Rhaegar did in order to birth Azor Ahai when he started Robert\\'s Rebellion. This is why I don\\'t think the readers are meant to see Rhaegar as doing the right thing.\\n\\nThe Stannis story is the most clear indicator of how the Azor Ahai prophecy and it\\'s connection with R\\'hllor and the Others is not that of a true hero. Melisandre is our main focus when it comes to Lord of Light magic, and she\\'s almost evil. We start with her burning the gods of the Seven, advocating the end of the religious semi-freedom in Westeros. Then she somehow tricks Stannis into killing his own brother in cold blood, later advocates burning Edric Storm alive, and in Dance Jon has to send Mance\\'s son away to ensure she wouldn\\'t murder the baby. It makes me think that Mel\\'s idea of a \"savior\" is not just the one who kills the Others, it\\'s the one who kills ALL non-believers, on the principle that their gods are servants of the Other.\\n\\nSAVIOR THREE: JON AND DANY AND...?\\n\\nThe books have strongly telegraphed that Jon is a possible savior, given the whole R+L=J, Song of Ice and Fire, return-from-the-dead thing. My prediction is that the characters at the Wall and in the North will see the same thing: Mel will bring Jon back to life, his parentage will be revealed (perhaps through Howland Reed), and people will rally around him as Azor Ahai, their savior. This is foreshadowed by what happens with Beric when he dies: a red priest brings him back, and his followers convert to R\\'hllor and start acting in the name of God. And the same thing is already happening with Dany in Essos: Volantene religious people are preaching that Dany is Azor Ahai, and armies are converging on Slaver\\'s Bay to eventually follow her as their god-given leader. As leader so far, Dany has done great good and great harm to the Bay: she frees slaves, but also kills anyone above 12; she tries to bring peace to Meereen, but her dragons kill children and the Shavepate leads her to torture. But her devotees don\\'t care because she is the Chosen One--what\\'s a shepherd\\'s child compared to the entire world?\\n\\nLet\\'s not forget that in the show, Tormund says that the men see Jon as a god after he comes back to life (this doesn\\'t lead anywhere), and Dany is chosen by the Dothraki because of her magic fireproofness. To me, these seem like ideas from George that weren\\'t properly executed in the show.\\n\\nMel has been asking the Lord of Light to show her Azor Ahai, but all she sees is Jon Snow. After his resurrection, she will \"correctly\" interpret the vision, and get to work on helping Jon forge is Lightbringer by killing Nissa Nissa; and it just so happens, his beloved \"sister\" is coming North to play the role. Jon will be changed by his death and return, as Catelyn was, becoming more vengeful and wanting to punish the \"sinners\". The transition won\\'t be obvious, as both characters and readers need to believe Jon is a hero at first, but that belief will be our undoing. We\\'ll excuse the deaths of innocents because their deaths were needed, or unavoidable, and Jon was simply doing what he had to.\\n\\nDany will come west with an army of worshippers, and her dragons will cause great death just as Aegon I did, but it will be okay because she also comes North and helps defeat the Others. Characters like Quaithe and Marwyn will push her on this path because they want her to fulfill prophecy, and she will follow in Rhaegar\\'s footsteps of causing countless deaths for the sake of some vague prophecy. And the readers will be tricked into cheering her on, as we cheered for Rhaegar when he started a war, as we will cheer for Jon when he forges Lightbringer, because the story sets them up as heroes. But in the end, they won\\'t be the true saviors of Westeros, and mankind\\'s salvation won\\'t come from chosen princes with magic swords and righteous armies.\\n\\nREMEMBER THE SPARROWS\\n\\nThe sparrow movement in Feast sums up George\\'s feeling\\'s about religious fanaticism pretty well. Warrior\\'s Sons like Lancel believe they see visions from gods, so they take up the righteous fight  and cause theocracy in KL that brings only violence and oppression, not justice. Why should believe this will be any different with R\\'hllor worshippers? They\\'re just another army leading a supposed chosen one against what they claim is evil, and causing more harm than good. That\\'s the problem with how we treat the Azor Ahai prophecy; we act like once the PTWP is revealed they will solve all the world\\'s problems, even though everything surrounding the prophecy in the story is connected to death, suffering, and fanatics.\\n\\nSo basically, it doesn\\'t actually matter who Azor Ahai is--and their emergence probably won\\'t be that helpful.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Recent post by u/ASongofNoOne inspired me with this idea. He gives there a scale of Bloodraven's magical abilities so I won't be explaining it here.\\n\\nWhat's the deal with Great Spring Sickness? F&amp;B tells us Valyrians are resistant to most ilnesses, though Shivers are an exception, as Daenerys succumbs to it.\\n\\n&gt; Princess Daenerys had been Targaryen on both sides, with the blood of Old Valyria running pure through her veins, and those of Valyrian descent were not like other men. Targaryens had purple eyes and hair of gold and silver, they ruled the sky on dragons, the doctrines of the Faith and the prohibitions against incest did not apply to them ... *and they did not get sick*.\\n\\n- The Long Reign\\n\\nShivers however is related to cold/ice- a contrary to Targaryens' element.\\n\\n&gt; It began simply enough, with a chill. Victims would complain of being cold, throw a fresh log on the fire, huddle under a blanket or a pile of furs. Some would call for hot soup, mulled wine, or, against all reason, beer. Neither blankets nor soups could stay the progress of the pestilence. Soon the shivering would begin; mild at first, a trembling, a shudder would march up and down the victim's limbs like conquering armies. By then the afflicted would be shivering so violently that their teeth would chatter, and their hands and feet would begin to convulse and twitch. When the victim's lips turned blue and he began to cough up blood, the end was nigh. Death would come within a day, and no more than one victim in every five recovered\\n\\n- The Long Reign\\n\\nGreat Spring Sickness on the other hand occured in Spring and there is nothing that suggests it had anything to do with cold/ice and Daeron was as well Targaryen on both sides and should be resistant to most of diseases. There are no clear statistics, only five out of ten recovered from Shivers and GSS killed 4 out of 10 people in King's Landing. It seems they are comparably lethal, and yet Shivers only killed a young Targaryen girl, and GSS managed to kill 3 grown male Targaryen- Daeron and his grandsons Valarr and Matarys. Surprisingly not meek and sickly Rhaegel, not bookish Aerys, but king and his two most immediate heirs. Conveniently GSS led to Aerys's ascension to the Iron Throne with Bloodraven as his new Hand of King. Could this all be a combination of a rare disease and a very bad luck? Or did Bloodraven kill his kin and guised it as a work of plague to seize control of Westeros?\",\n",

He comes to the conclusion that Ramsay probably wrote it, reason being no one else writing it has textual evidence to support them *and* a motive to do so. But if Ramsay wrote the letter, why is it the wax smeared, the ink different, and Ramsay the only signatory? \\n\\nSimple. Ramsay\\'s maester, Tybald, wrote the other letters while Ramsay dictate to him but he has since been captured by Stannis. Maesters, owing to years of training, presumably have steady hands and are neat and orderly. Ramsay doesn\\'t have the need to be, plus he\\'s probably the only signatory because this letter was supposed to be personal, not political.\\n\\nThe letter is signed as \"Ramsay Bolton, the trueborn lord of Winterfell,\" but he never said trueborn in his other letters even though he had already been legitimized. I see no reason to believe Mel or Stannis or Mance would implicitly call Jon a bastard, but if Ramsay wrote it it\\'s incredibly easy to see him doing so out of spite.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Numerous characters have been theorized as the Night\\'s King 2.0 (Stannis, Euron, etc.). And while I think strong parallels can be made between the Night\\'s King and [certain characters](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/czrdy0/bloodraven_vs_the_nights_king_a_comparison/), I am unsure if we will ever actual see a physical representation of him in the series. That said, I noticed some interesting parallels (that have probably been discussed before) and wanted to share.\\n\\n**There are some interesting parallels between Craster\\'s activities and the Night\\'s King\\'s**\\n\\n***\\n\\n#Sons vs. Seed\\n\\n**Craster gives his sons to the wood\"\\n\\n&gt;\"For the baby, not for me. If it\\'s a girl, that\\'s not so bad, she\\'ll grow a few years and he\\'ll marry her. But Nella says it\\'s to be a boy, and she\\'s had six and knows these things. **He gives the boys to the gods. Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often**. That\\'s why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the sheep\\'s gone too. Next it will be dogs, till . . .\" She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly. -ACOK, Jon III\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"Hearth tales. Does Craster seem less than human to you?\"\\n\\n&gt;In half a hundred ways. **\"He gives his sons to the wood.\"** \\n\\n&gt;A long silence. Then: \"Yes.\" And \"Yes,\" the raven muttered, strutting. \"Yes, yes, yes.\" -ACOK, Jon III\\n\\n**The Night\\'s King\\'s Seed**\\n\\n&gt;A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. **Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well**. -ASOS, Bran IV\\n\\nSo we have both Craster/The Night\\'s King giving their \"sons\"/seed to the Others/cold gods/wood. Also note that Bloodraven seems to be in agreement.\\n\\n***\\n\\n#Sacrificing\\n\\n&gt;After his fall, **when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others**, all records of Night\\'s King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden. -ASOS, Bran IV\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;She punched him again. \"Craster\\'s more your kind than ours. His father was a crow who stole a woman out of Whitetree village, but after he had her he flew back t\\' his Wall. She went t\\' Castle Black once t\\' show the crow his son, but the brothers blew their horns and run her off. Craster\\'s blood is black, and **he bears a heavy curse.**\" She ran her fingers lightly across his stomach. \"I feared you\\'d do the same once. Fly back to the Wall. You never knew what t\\' do after you stole me.\" \\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;Gilly had spoken of the white cold as well, and she\\'d told them **what sort of offerings Craster made to his gods**. Sam had wanted to kill him when he heard. There are no laws beyond the Wall, he reminded himself, and Craster\\'s a friend to the Watch. -ASOS, Samwell II\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n#GRRM\\'s description of the Others\\n\\n&gt;The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… **the Sidhe made of ice**, something like that… a different sort of life… inhuman, elegant, dangerous. -[SSM, A Game of Thrones: The Graphic Novel, Volume I:  (https://books.google.com/books?id=i_SorqUvsOEC&amp;lpg=PT203&amp;ots=5oK3EkTd8Y&amp;pg=PT203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\\n\\nThe [Aos Sí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_Sí) which is what it can be assumed that GRRM meant when he said Sidhe as Wikipedia states:\\n\\n&gt;Some secondary and tertiary sources, including well-known and influential authors such as W. B. Yeats, refer to aos sí simply as \"the sídhe\" (lit. \"mounds\").\\n\\nBut what I found interesting was the [Leanan sídhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leanan_sídhe) which basically means **Irish fairy lover**:\\n\\n&gt;According to the tragic romance of the period, the leannán sí (\"Fairy-Lover\") is a beautiful woman of the Aos Sí (\"people of the barrows\") who takes a human lover. Lovers of the leannán sídhe are said to live brief, though highly inspired, lives. \\n\\nWhich matches nicely with: \\n&gt;In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself in the earliest days of the Watch. **Some suggest that perhaps the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves**. The Night\\'s King has been said to have been variously a Bolton, a Woodfoot, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or even a Stark, depending on where the tale is told. Like all tales, it takes on the attributes that make it most appealing to those who tell it.  -TWOIAF, The Wall and Beyond: The Night\\'s Watch\\n\\n***\\n\\nI want to make it very clear I don\\'t think that Craster is the Night\\'s King, just that his actions are similar to the legend of the The Night\\'s King, especially considering how legends get certain facts twisted, etc. This makes me want to dive deeper into the Others/The Night\\'s King and characters with similar relationships such as Bloodraven/Shiera, Euron/unknown queen and Stannis/Mel.\\n\\n**TLDR: Some interesting parallels between what Craster was doing and what the Night\\'s King was doing as well, especially when looking at how GRRM described the Others**',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello everyone! :) \\n\\nDany POV (chapter 68) of the first book begins with her fiery dream brought on by the miscarriage. I have read many times before, but it has never been a dream that I was noticed beyond the egg cracking issue. However, when I looked at it recently, I thought it might be more interesting. I would like to discuss it together.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;Wings shadowed her fever dreams. \"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\\n\\nThis is the first sentence. The beginning is very ironic because this sentence is the sentence that Dany fears Viserys would say ... When he said this, Viserys threatened to beat her and finally beat her. So the dream begins with the fear of Dany, but Viserys is dead now, so she does not need to be afraid of this sentence.\\n\\n*Despite this, a dragon will really wake up…*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; She was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches. She could not look behind her, must not look behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone.   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\\n\\nWe can think of the long corridor as the life journey of Dany (Turkish Bard Aşık Veysel has a song on this subject; I\\'m on a Long Thin Road\\\\[ uzun ince bir yoldayım\\\\]) She doesn\\'t look back, she must not look because the mistakes she made / the pain and the dark things she experienced remain in the past, she looks lost in these paines ; To me, the formula of Dany\\'s effort to keep her psychology intact is never but never looking back, but there are not only these in the dream. The door at the end of the road is red. This symbolizes Dany’s homesickness.\\n\\nHer bare foot may already be referring to his running barefoot in the grass while living in this house, so there may have been a reference to his childhood, and the blood was probably miscarried; A sign that she has lost her baby. (It may also be a sign that she will create a bloody path for the throne.) Of course, we immediately hear the sentence that triggers that fear again from behind. Actually, this was a threat to Dany in past, remember. But in this dream, I doubt it is a threat to Dany. It could be for us.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; She saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind stirred the grasses, and they rippled like water. Drogo held her in strong arms, and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on them, stars in a daylight sky. \"Home,\" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"… don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDany had long lost her childhood home, but Drogo and his people; this Dothrak sea and land were now her new home, and Drogo is her family. But dragon fire destroyed everything, including Drogo and his house.\\n\\nI want to stop here a bit. Dany does not have an ordinary dream. He sees dragon dreams that many of his ancestors had. These dreams lead the person who sees it. (if he knows how to use it). However, according to Aemon, dragon dreams had been the disaster of their siblings, but my personal opinion was probably due to their fear of these dreams or their becoming obsessed like Egg. After all, this is a power, and you should adopt and control this power without fear, or any power you cannot control becomes your disaster. In fact, Melisandre had said a word in his POV that implies similar things; about the nature of power, etc.\\n\\nIf we look at the northern forces, things like green dreams are sent by the Northern Gods through  Weirwood , which is believed. We saw in Jon that his dreams are sent by BR. \\n\\nIn summary, there are someone who sends prophetic dreams; this must also apply to dragon dreams. Melisandre believes that her god is talking to her through fires. Dragon dreams are essentially fire somehow, after all, we see plenty of fire.\\n\\nOkay, the point I want to reach without extending the subject ... This is just a interpretation, I can not say that there is very precise evidence, something pushed me to think like this ... There is someone who uses Dany and sends her dreams (R\\'hllor or someone like him) . If we set out from the idea that she is the champion of fire, he needs to take everything from her (her husband, child and close everyone). A husband and a child would cause Dany to count where she is. She can never go that way. A child and husband and a family are an obstacle to Dany\\'s task. \\n\\nIf you are careful, Drogo has actually been a home for Dany, but the giant wings (this dragon) are destroying  Drogo (the person and more that Dany has accepted as home) and the small world that Dany has built. There is no longer anything to prevent Dany from integrating with fire and become the bride / mother of the dragon, the bride of the flames.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;Ser Jorah\\'s face was drawn and sorrowful. \"Rhaegar was the last dragon,\" he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. \"The last dragon,\" he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"… don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI think it is most likely that after the Drogo scene, the warming scene of the eggs on the stove (fire) will show what Dany should do.\\n\\nApart from that, the red door goes further away and the darkness from behind has come close to her and does Dany feel it. I think this part is important because the darkness is when the term of the Great Other and is associated with death. Death close to her but and she is away from home(life). She is almost dead, so close.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Viserys stood before her, screaming. \"The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\" The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \"I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\" he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"… don\\'t want to wake the dragon …\"\\n\\nThe sentence began to change shape slowly. Now instead of threats and questions, we see \" don\\'t want to wake the dragon ...\" \\n\\nFirst Drogo and the dragon eggs scene, then Viserys\\' way of death and speech. The first stage is somewhat irrelevant and why was it put here? it makes you think. I will write the first thing that comes to my mind.\\n\\nViserys was a lesson. He was arrogant, not knowing to wait; he was acting with his uncontrolled feelings. Viserys\\' dragon was often awakened and turned into a cruel character when it woke up. This cruelty, arrogance and lack of control of his emotions gave him a melted crown. He succumbed to the throne ambition. That\\'s why we heard his words about it. I think this is a warning for Dany. Look at Viserys, keep your dragon asleep and don\\'t behave like him, or your end will be like him, Dany ... Is that why you hear \" don\\'t want to wake the dragon ...\", why did the sentence change? Because it is no longer a threat and has become a warning sentence.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;The red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She began to run.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"… don\\'t want to wake the dragon …\"\\n\\nThe door stands far away and behind the icy breath… Seeing this before and after the Viserys scene can be a scene that supports the above interpretation. Dark and icy breath; It is something attributed to the Great Other by Melisandre. Lord of Darkness, Spirit of Ice, death… etc. he says that death is also cold and dark. According to Benerro\\'s warning, there were enemies who were struggling for Dany\\'s disaster, of course, we think first these are the masters, but the main enemies he mentions are probably the more dangerous ones. If Dany is AA then the ice side must have taken action to destroy her.\\n\\nCould the icy breath in the dark show that death is now recognizing her and chasing her? Mirri returned someone who almost died with black magic from the door of death, by opening the door of the underworld, inviting the shadows of death, etc.  So logically Great Other saw this place and Dany when he entered? He learned who she was and acted? Could the dream warn her about this?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; She could feel the heat inside her, a terrible burning in her womb. Her son was tall and proud, with Drogo\\'s copper skin and her own silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers, but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out. She saw his heart burning through his chest, and in an instant he was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin.   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"… want to wake the dragon …\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDany sees her son as an adult, and her son dies by burning. The heart burning inside his chest reminds Stannis\\' personal flaming heart emblem, which is a emblem representing R’hllor because one of R\\'hllor\\'s names is the heart of fire. Naturally, this creates the impression that R’hllor has chosen Dany and owned her, but she paid the price; lost her son and husband and more. So one more sign can be said to be AA.\\n\\nThe sentence is changing shape again. It is now becoming an action. Awakening the dragon… Is Dany\\'s son the real price paid to awaken the dragons? Likely.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;Ghosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their hands were swords of pale fire. They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade. \"Faster,\" they cried, \"faster, faster.\" She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever they touched. \"Faster!\" the ghosts cried as one, and she screamed and threw herself forward. A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"… wake the dragon …\"\\n\\nAnd now the dragon is waking up. Another sign can be seen that it is AA. Flaming swords and kings wearing pale clothes. This part reminded me of Bakkalon; he was a pale looking boy holding a sword in his hand. These are kings wearing pale clothes, holding flaming swords in their hands.\\n\\nProbably these are her ancestors; hair colors and unusual eye colors indicate this, but there is another situation. We have seen that Targaryens usually have indigo eyes or lilac eyes, except that only one eye of Alyssa Targaryen (daughter of Jae-Alysanne) was lilac while the other was green. The definition of Amethyst, Opal, Tourmal and Jade eyes reminds me of the kings / queens of the Dawn Empire. As far as we know, there are no Targ kings with these eye colors for the past 300 years, as well as Targlar, King etc. And in Freehol of Valyria there was no such title.\\n\\nSo what are these ancestors then? These seem to go back to much older times. First Long Night… First AA…?\\n\\nThese encourage our girl, they say speed up; Remember the death and darkness from behind, she has to escape from him, and she must also turn into a dragon, which is turning. The stone she stepped on is melting with dragon fire, which means she is now a dragon. Wings come out and Dany is flying now. Flying in this series has an important and remarkable event and meaning.  (Like Bran)\\n\\nI think we see the moment when the power in Dany wakes up; she is evolving and flying. This is probably what prevented her from burning at the funeral fire. She became a dragon fire, melting the place she stepped on, iher wings coming out and flying… When she entered the funeral fire, it was saying “I am fire”. It is quite compatible with the dream, but yes, it was only a one-time event that not burning. After all, Dany isn\\'t really a dragon with wings, but a human being, but a special person.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"… the dragon …\"\\n\\nShe reached her house, the door opened. In fact, Dany turned into the person she must be, she became a dragon, she gathered her strength. She began to fly above Dothrak the sea, rising higher and higher. The one who sees him is afraid of him and runs away ... If she reaches the house, she will keep her warm and embrace her, etc. there is.\\n\\nLook, the part is very important. Now… What was the red door? Dany\\'s home, but in fact, Dany is making a miscarriage in the real world and is almost died. So, Dany is fighting a life and death. The dark and cold breathing death that follows him is trying to take her out of life and kill her, if in this dream the darkness had reached her, Dany would have been 100% dead, she would never wake up again, and her story would have ended at the end of the first book.\\n\\nSo Dany, she\\'s running to the red door, that door is actually a door to hold on to life rather than her home; When she got there, the dark breath got away from her, and he kidnapped Dany from his fingers, now she came out of the land of death, Dany won her battle with death. The evolution / transformation she experienced has enabled this. She strengthened.\\n\\nSo the sentence has changed again, became the \"dragon\", now its transformation is complete. Dany can then act to achieve her goal. She knows what to do.\\n\\nIn my opinion, there is another point that needs attention. Flying over the Dothrak sea, rising high all the time and frightening everyone who sees it is a FS to those who see Dany in Essos. She flew, flew and flew… High and higher. Those who saw her frightened, fled, and seized her foot. Okay, it was a bit overdone, but you understood what I meant.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;And saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm. \"The last **dragon**,\" Ser Jorah\\'s voice whispered faintly. \"The last, the last.\" Dany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;After that, for a long time, there was only the pain, the fire within her, and the whisperings of stars.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; She woke to the taste of ashes. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe end of the dream. The person Dany thinks is Rhaegar is actually Dany herself. Dany is the last dragon. At least in her dream and in her own reality. The awakening of the ashes with its taste is also the effect of the fire and ashes that she dreams of.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI will continue with the funeral inşallah, because it is connected. Thank you for read and sorry again for my poor English. Hope you enjoy it.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"**Firstly, what is the turn around of announcement, to having the book on the shelves?**\\n\\nI have only started reading in large quantities in the last 2 years and haven't had the change to see a announcement for a book I was waiting for until very recently with Stormlight book 4 was announced for November 2020, almost a year after the initial announcement date.\\n\\nSo I was wondering what it was like with George, as Brandon is a very fast writer and updates his fans with a literal progress bar on his website, so It's quite a different experience.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell Dance was announced only a few months before release. Is this true for George on average? Or could his announcement of Winds be an eternity away from the release date?\\n\\n**Secondly, did the ASOIAF audio-books generally release on the same day as the book release, or are they after the fact?**\\n\\nI own all the books on paper, but could never get through them, since picking up Audible I've read over 50 books in the last year or two, reading ASOIAF and Harry Potter twice over in that time too.\\n\\nSo for me Winds in audio form is essential for me, and I'd have to know it was getting released say in November of year 202X, and I'd have to wait months for my turn.\\n\\n**Thirdly, knowing George best as long time fans, what is your honest opinion of a likely release window, or are all bets off now-a-days?**\\n\\nOnly being a mega-fan for some 2 years I am still a sweet summer child, and hold out hope every year that it will truly release. 2020 is no different. I am hoping for some snap announcement, quick turn around, and BOOM book in our hands.\\n\\nI know long time fans are far more jaded and sceptical (for good reason), so I was interested of what long time fans think.\\n\\n**Lastly, on quite a sour note, do you believe we'll ever see a dream of spring?**\\n\\nI am hopeful, but getting less so as every Winds free day passes.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"**Firstly, what is the turn around of announcement, to having the book on the shelves?**\\n\\nI have only started reading in large quantities in the last 2 years and haven't had the change to see a announcement for a book I was waiting for until very recently with Stormlight book 4 was announced for November 2020, almost a year after the initial announcement date.\\n\\nSo I was wondering what it was like with George, as Brandon is a very fast writer and updates his fans with a literal progress bar on his website, so It's quite a different experience.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell Dance was announced only a few months before release. Is this true for George on average? Or could his announcement of Winds be an eternity away from the release date?\\n\\n**Secondly, did the ASOIAF audio-books generally release on the same day as the book release, or are they after the fact?**\\n\\nI own all the books on paper, but could never get through them, since picking up Audible I've read over 50 books in the last year or two, reading ASOIAF and Harry Potter twice over in that time too.\\n\\nSo for me Winds in audio form is essential for me, and I'd have to know it was getting released say in November of year 202X, and I'd have to wait months for my turn.\\n\\n**Thirdly, knowing George best as long time fans, what is your honest opinion of a likely release window, or are all bets off now-a-days?**\\n\\nOnly being a mega-fan for some 2 years I am still a sweet summer child, and hold out hope every year that it will truly release. 2020 is no different. I am hoping for some snap announcement, quick turn around, and BOOM book in our hands.\\n\\nI know long time fans are far more jaded and sceptical (for good reason), so I was interested of what long time fans think.\\n\\n**Lastly, on quite a sour note, do you believe we'll ever see a dream of spring?**\\n\\nI am hopeful, but getting less so as every Winds free day passes.\",\n",

How far would news like that travel especially for certain characters like Brynden Tully who was devoted to Robb Stark, would he then travel North to Winterfell to see if the North will come down on House Frey for total Vengeance for the Red Wedding.\\n\\nI wanted to discuss this Region by Region starting with The Vale, the most prominent character there is obviously Sansa Stark. And with her being at court, news will travel quick and be discussed at length especially with most people believing House Stark were dead due to Bran and Rickon being believed dead and no news on Arya/Sansa. Even though she is trying to achieve Little Fingers goal in marrying Harry the Heir would she not want to return home to the safety of Wintefell if the Bolton are extinct and all potential allies of the Boltons being put into place. I could see Lord Royce wanting to make an alliance with the North and trying to push it due to his distant relations with House Stark and not helping them in the first place against the Lannisters.\\n\\nThe Riverlands, will Lady Stoneheart hear about House Stark being restored to the Northern Kingdom and will she travel North to see who is in charge there. Also The Freys will probably be very fearful that a United North with Stannis will come down and take the twins with full force in revenge for the Red Wedding and other Riverlands Houses now fully Uniting to take the Freys down. They will have enemies everywhere with not even the Lannisters not being able to help them. Where ever The Blackfish went after escaping Riverrun if he hears that House Stark has retaken the North I can't see him not going to his kin in trying to persuade them to destroy House Frey for what they have done in orchestrating the biggest betrayal Westeros has seen a long time.\\n\\nThe Reach, with what is going on with House Tyrell I can't see such a fuss especially with Faegon taking the Stormlands and them still in alliance with House Lannister at this point although they will probably be plotting other potential alliances in case King's Landing is taken. \\n\\nThe Crownlands, I can see Cersei finding out about what has happened in the North and being furious and still wanting revenge for what happened to Joffrey but unable to do anything due to the chaos that is starting to emerge around them.\\n\\nThe Stormlands, Faegon is still preparing his route to Kings Landing with the Golden Company so The North will not concern him yet. \\n\\nDorne, Too far away to really have any consideration in what has happened will likely hear of what has happened in the North. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think?\",\n",

But as House Bolton do have the advantage, will their be a massive twist in the upcoming battle for Winterfell in terms of other Houses turning unexpectadely against House Bolton that turns into a scenario of what is going on type of thing.\\n\\nHouse Manderley did a deal with Ser Davos in support for Stannis as long as Rickon Stark is brought back to the North so the other houses can rally behind House Stark. However, Stannis does not know this deal has taken place or that Ser Davos is even alive. So Stannis has the mountain clans, what ever men he has, House Mormont and Glover. Whereas House Bolton has The Karstarks and other houses to scared to rise up against them. And we still don't know or unsure of House Umber although I'd like to believe when Rickon turns up they will stand behind him.\\n\\nSo, I was thinking of how amazing it was when House Arryn did turn up in the TV Series like the Ride of the Rohirmm in Lord of the Rings and would be a great twist if unknowing of Stannis that House Mandereley would do the same with House Stark's banner leading the charge. Stannis wouldn't know what would be happening and neither would the Bolton's who could see a collapse, I do think something will happen to Roose and he will get his end as revenge for Robb Stark. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think or do you think there will be a different twist?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'While I had more positive view of final season than most and saw far more story elements that must have come from GRRM compared to the previous two seasons, the part where Bran becomes king of \"6 kingdoms\" while at the same time North becomes independent under Sansa never sat right with me. Rest of the season I could accept as broad outline of what could be the ending of the novels (Yes even Jaime\\'s ending) if they ever come out, but not that final part. Yet allegedly that was one of the bits that came directly from George.   \\n\\n\\nThus when I looked into it I found this quote from Ian Hempstead Wright:  “David \\\\[Benioff\\\\] and Dan \\\\[Weiss\\\\] told me there were two things George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran,” he said in an HBO [behind-the-scenes interview](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-finale-isaac-hempstead-wright-bran-interview). “And that was the [Hodor revelation](https://www.vulture.com/2016/05/game-of-thrones-hodor-what-happened.html), and that he would be king. \"  \\n\\n\\nNote the last word. It\\'s just \"king\" without further specification. I think in the books it is far more probable that Bran would ultimately become king in the North rather than that of \"6 kingdoms\". There would be no need for Tyrion\\'s grandiose speech about \"a great story\".   \\n\\n\\nAs things stand even by existing laws of the land, he is litteraly next in the line (since Robb legitimised Jon) and thus would be accepted by Northerners (He is even named Brandon like their rulers of old and is son and brother of their beloved recent rulers). While on the other hand 6 kingdoms banding together and accepting a crippled Northern boy as a ruler while at the same time North is independent simply makes no sense and diminishes the symbolism of Iron throne being melted down.   \\n\\n\\nIn fact it\\'s a wonder 7 kingdoms didn\\'t go their own way some 150 years before the plot of the books let alone after everything that happened. I also doubt Dothraki would just leave. I think various kos would form their own little states in the Crownlands and Western Reach with hybrid Westerosi-Dothraki culture (now that is something I\\'d like to see) but I digress.  \\n\\n\\nWhat I think happened is the showrunners found out about this revelation far too late when they\\'ve already built up Sansa\\'s future role as queen and changed her Vale storyline. In the books her path is also that of governance but IMO not over the North but over the Vale, probably officially as a consort  of either Harry the Heir or Sweet Robin, but unofficially as true power behind the throne following the footsteps of LF ;).',\n",

       "   'selftext': '&gt;\"In ancient books of Asshai it is written that **there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword.** And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\" -Melisandre, Davos I, ACOK\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\n* Jon killing Daenerys to reforge Lightbringer (although not killing Daenerys in general) is mostly off the menu. Not only is the bleeding star gone as of ADWD, but Daenerys is not \"the fire\" except in a sense of the word so loose as to be practically meaningless. Which is not the kind of sense GRRM uses in his prophecies; the ones we have seen come to pass (Patchface\\'s about the Purple Wedding, the Ghost of High Heart\\'s about Balon\\'s death) were much more specific to the events they described. GRRM wants to trick us with riddles that are solvable, not ones that require us to guess from a thousand different possible things vaguely similar to a given word. \\n\\n* Daenerys\\'s hatching of the dragon eggs in Drogo\\'s pyre while the comet was overhead still counts in the metaphorical sense. Which is why the church of R\\'hllor considers her the Azor Ahai prophecy\\'s fulfillment. Of course, is it likely that the official dogma of this religion, which GRRM clearly does not want us to look at in a positive light, is correct? Will the religious fundamentalists really turn out to be right about the world?\\n\\n* Euron drawing Lightbringer from the fiery ruins of Valyria off-page at the end of AGOT would fit extremely well. \\n\\nWe know from TWOIAF the Valyrians used spells to control the Fourteen Flames. \\n\\n&gt;A handful of maesters, influenced by fragments of the work of Septon Barth, hold that Valyria had used spells to tame the Fourteen Flames for thousands of years, that their ceaseless hunger for slaves and wealth was as much to sustain these spells as to expand their power, and that when at last those spells faltered, the cataclysm became inevitable. -TWOIAF\\n\\nThis is so widely accepted in-universe even some maesters believe it. Septon Barth believes it. It\\'s basically canon. But we have no idea *how* they did it. And we seem to have one pre-Valyrian instance of someone else doing it.\\n\\n&gt;\"I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife\\'s blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot. **Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.\"** -Jon, Jon III, ADWD\\n\\nThis is a picture perfect metaphor for volcanic eruption, induced by Azor Ahai\\'s legendary blade.\\n\\nWhat if the Valyrians were gifted the weapon by the people from the Shadow who taught them to ride dragons? What if they used Azor Ahai\\'s \"nuclear weapon\" of a sword as a \"nuclear reactor\" to regulate their volcanoes and the power of their fire-based spells? What if they kept it from \"going critical\" with containment spells, fueled by an steady supply of slaves for blood sacrifice? What if when those spells failed Lightbringer went Chernobyl?\\n\\nAnd what if that same sword is now onboard the Silence?\\n\\n&gt;The light was too bright to look upon, and Aeron was afraid of what it meant. Bright and terrible. Something has changed. Something has happened. -The Forsaken, TWOW',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hello everyone,\\n\\nI know that there have been tons of topics about this exact question, but hear me out.\\n\\nFron what I saw in all the threads I read about reading AFFC and ADWD, everyone is encouraged to read in the publisher order, and then try boiled leather/a feast for dragons on the 1st/2nd re-read. Here's the thing though : I'm 99% certain that I will not re-read the books.\\n\\nJust to give you some context, I'm ABSOLUTELY not a reader, the ASOIAF books are almost the only books I read for my own pleasure. All the other books I've read were for school/uni, ... I'm a fan of the show and I wasn't happy with the ending (surprising, right), so I forced myself to try reading the books. And I am very glad I did, because I really enjoy it, in fact I just finished ASoS today.\\n\\nBut I'm a slow reader,  and I get bored of books quickly and not touch one for a month if I don't feel like it. That's why I'm pretty sure I won't read the books again.\\n\\nSo here's the golden question: For someone who knows he won't read the books again, would you recommend a combined reading of AFFC and ADWD or is the published order good enough? \\n\\nI'm afraid that I will get bored of AFFC, because from what I've read on this subject, AFFC is boring compared to the other books until the last few chapters. But I'm also afraid of not picking up important details because there are too much storylines to follow :/\\n\\nThanks a lot for taking the time to hear me out, and I appreciate all answers :)\",\n",

I\\'ve tried looking for this theory on this subreddit, seems like there isn\\'t such a theory so I went on my merry way to make it one. **Our Summer Islander is a Dornish spy**.\\n\\n\\\\- The line that started the theory off. \\n\\n&gt;Prince Doran took a jagged breath. \"Dorne still has **friends** at **court**. **Friends** who tell us things we were not meant to know. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying Xho is the only Dornish friend, but he certainly is 1 friend the Dornish have. The line shows his Doran\\'s friends are close to those with power. And what will you know, people at court have been used to seeing him at court and seeing as he hasn\\'t pissed anyone off yet, people think of him as friendly but irrelevant. He was on decent terms with Robert and never pissed him off. And now he\\'s aligned himself with the future queen. This shows he has a good sense of where power is held and tries to suck up to them. He\\'s the perfect guy to hear court gossip\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe is as important as a minor lord in Westeros, a good position to be in if he were a spy, coz people wouldn\\'t consider him to be a threat.\\n\\n&gt;After them followed the High Septon in his litter, and a long tail of other courtiers—Ser Horas Redwyne, Lady Tanda and her daughter, Jalabhar **Xho**, Lord Gyles Rosby, and the rest.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe\\'s well accustomed to how things are run in the court and is keen to learn new developments of the politics of Westeros.\\n\\n&gt;This was the first court session of Joffrey\\'s reign ....... under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly. There were no more than twenty, where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon King Robert. ....... She recognized black-skinned **Jalabhar** **Xho**, gloomy Ser Aron Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nStarts ingratiating with Tyrells first at Sansa\\'s wedding, by dancing with one of Margaery\\'s ladies. The time when most in Westeros think that peace has come, and thus a good time to gather allies for an attack.\\n\\n&gt;Merry Crane took the floor with the exile prince Jalabhar **Xho**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nXho meets with the Martell envoy along with Tyrion, where he gets the chance to meet up with Oberyn. It\\'s unlikely that Tywin thought of Xho as he\\'s just a footnote at court, more likely that Xho volunteered for this. At this point, Xho could\\'ve offered his services to Oberyn. Plus, since Oberyn probably frequented the brothels, he\\'d have heard about Chataya. Xho could be friends with the whores and could\\'ve asked them to instil pity in Oberyn for the Summer Isle cause. \\n\\n&gt;Tyrion could hear Lord Gyles coughing as well. He had not asked for Gyles, no more than he\\'d asked for Ser Addam or Jalabhar **Xho** or any of the rest, but his lord father felt Doran Martell might take it ill if only a dwarf came out to escort him across the Blackwater.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe learn a lot of Summer Islander culture through Sam\\'s travels and other summer islanders scattered throughout the world. When researching for this theory, the mention of Summer islanders and their culture increased significantly in AFFC and ADWD. This along with Xho being a big part of Cersei\\'s conspiracy against Margaery, suggests they have a role to play in the future. Not a story changing role, but a role regardless. What is this role, the attempted conquest of Summer Isles under Xho. I doubt we will see this happen, but it\\'s Xho\\'s entire goal and explains his actions. Maybe Xho could offer mercenaries to support one of the 7 kingdoms in their war along with Summer Isle navy in exchange. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***TLDR***: **This is pure speculation as I couldn\\'t find concrete proof that he is spying for Dorne**. Xho is Doran\\'s spy in King\\'s Landing in the hopes of Dornish support for the conquest of the Summer Isles. But he\\'s also playing the Tyrells in case either ally abandons him. Both allies can provide decent/stong navies and strong armies, so he only needs 1.',\n",

In the books all it takes for Vicatarion to partially convert is the healing of his hand by Moqorro, so you figure a person that was definetly brought back to life by R'hllor would think of converting or convert, which he may do in the books.

       "   'selftext': \"Someone said elsewhere: if the Three-Eyed Crow is not Bloodraven, Bran's story would be reduced to a travelogue - Bran would have to *again* journey to find his *real* mentor, all his development wasted. \\n\\nThis thesis is a narratological argument that does *not* cleave to the kind of story to which the story of Bran belongs.  \\n\\n## Whence the argument?\\n---\\nThis argument appears to be rooted in a classical three-act structure where: A) the Hero is confronted by a Great Evil, B) the Hero is trained by the Mentor, C) the Hero defeats the Great Evil.\\n\\n## The Hero and the Mentor\\n--- \\n\\nThe Hero is an ordinary boy revealed to be a chosen one - of great power, but also great immaturity. To defeat the Great Evil that confronts him, he must be taught to wield his power by a Mentor. \\n\\nThis is an archetypal story structure called the Hero's Journey, as-popularised by Joseph Campbell. It is comparable to the narrative theories of, for example, Vladimir Propp.\\n\\n&gt; ##### A note on narrative theory\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The Hero's Journey is specifically derivative of Western myths and folklore, and is criticised for its generalised structure and its male-centric gaze. It, for example, might struggle to be applied to a police story or a lesbian romance novel. \\n&gt;\\n&gt; \\n&gt; ##### Police stories\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Reading from: *Harriss, C 2011, ‘The Evidence Doesn't Lie: Genre literacy and the CSI Effect’, Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television, Vol. 39, No. 1, 2-11.*\\n&gt; \\n&gt; All characters within a police story represent either an investigator, a perpetrator, an expert, an informer, or a misinformer. A crime occurs, a victim is discovered, and investigators progressively discover more clues and snares until a perpetrator can be identified, who is either falsely accused or guilty. The investigation then either resumes or concludes, with the guilty being removed from society in some way.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; ##### Lesbian romance novels\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Reading from: *Juhasz, S 1998, Lesbian Romance Fiction and the Plotting of Desire: Narrative Theory, Lesbian Identity, and Reading Practice, Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, Vol. 17, No. 1, 65-82.)*\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Girl meets girl, girl loses girl, girl gets girl - but sexual identity and heteronormative culture is itself a likely to be a source of conflict in the story. The mother-daughter relationship is also the primary social context, expressing their relationship with other women, and with their own maturation.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; ##### Why these examples? \\n&gt; \\n&gt; *Genre savviness* is a real academic tool that informs how producers and consumers understand different kinds of stories. How many times has a TV audience seen a police story on the screen and thought, this is a red herring? This is the Maverick?\\n\\n## Bran's story, a Hero's Journey? \\n--- \\n\\nBran is an ordinary boy who discovers he is the Chosen One, and goes to be instructed by a wise old man. Soon, he must face a great evil that threatens to destroy the world.\\n\\nSo, if Bran must be instructed by a wise old man, why would Bloodraven *not* be the wise old man? One, however, does not preclude the other. In a Hero's Journey, a Mentor is a figure of secrets and revelations.\\n\\nArguing that premise argues the conclusion that either: \\n\\n1. The Last Greenseer, Bloodraven, is not the Three-Eyed Crow. \\n2. The Last Greenseer *is* the Three-Eyed Crow, but he is evil. \\n3. The Last Greenseer hides a secret of great significance to Bran.\\n\\n## Comparative narrative theory \\n---\\n\\n##### Harry Potter\\nHarry Potter is an ordinary, orphaned child that discovers he is a wizard - and the chosen one. He is invited into a world of magic by a wise old man, and learns to defeat the dark lord Voldemort. \\n\\nThough, in truth, there are many *wise old men* in the story of Harry Potter - and most of them are not what they seem. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Dumbledore\\n\\n&gt; Throughout The Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore’s legacy and his relationship with Harry is constantly dissected. It is revealed that he was not always kind, but that he was very close with the world’s last dark wizard, Grindelwald, that he was partly responsible for the death of his own sister, that he never even told Harry that he had a brother…\\n\\n&gt; In fact, he kept a lot of secrets from Harry, and Harry begins to resent him. As Harry thinks: “Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?” And as one other old wizard says to him: “Honestly, my boy – are you sure you knew him at all?” \\n\\n&gt; ##### Hagrid\\n\\n&gt; In The Chamber of Secrets, Hagrid is revealed to be behind the monster in the castle, though this is then revealed to be a red herring.\\n\\n&gt; ##### Lupin\\n\\n&gt; Lupin is first revealed to have been a friend of Sirius Black, then believed to be a murderer, and then a werewolf. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Snape\\n\\n&gt; Snape is revealed to be an informer, Dumbledore’s spy, and to have been besotted with Harry’s mother.\\n\\n&gt; \\n\\n&gt; ##### Moody\\n\\n&gt; Moody is revealed to not have been Moody at all, but an agent of Voldemort in disguise. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Other teachers\\n\\n&gt; Quirrell is secretly Voldemort’s surrogate. Lockhart stole his stories... \\n\\nHagrid is the sole mentor figure in the life of Harry Potter to not be a figure of mystery (excepting, arguably, Sirius). Even *he* is the subject of reveals - and does a second reveal negate the first?\\n\\n##### Star Wars\\nLuke Skywalker is an ordinary moisture farmer who is revealed to be the Chosen One. He meets a wise old wizard who teaches him the ways of the force, and then casts down the Dark Lords of the Sith.\\n\\n&gt; ##### Obi-Wan\\n\\n&gt; Much of Kenobi’s secrets are revealed posthumously by other characters – that Darth Vader is Luke’s father, that Leia is his sister, and that Obi-Wan has secretly been watching over Luke for his whole life. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Yoda\\n\\n&gt; Yoda first appears to Luke as an irrelevant, bumbling, lunatic hermit. He is then revealed to be a master wizard. Later, he reveals that there is another Skywalker (Leia)… \\n\\n\\n##### Eragon\\nEragon is an ordinary peasant who stumbles upon a dragon egg, and is inducted by a wise old man into the world of dragon riders. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Brom\\n\\n&gt; On his deathbed, Brom reveals that he was a dragon rider – and that his dragon’s name was Saphira (the same as Eragon’s dragon). Later, it is revealed that Brom was Eragon’s father, and that he was secretly watching other Eragon for his whole life. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Oromis \\n\\n&gt; Oromis is the old elf that Eragon seeks out in the elven forest. He reveals that Brom was Eragon's father. \\n\\n##### The Lord of the Rings\\nFrodo is an ordinary hobbit who is coincidentally given a magic ring, and is inducted by a wise old man into a world beyond the borders of the Shire - a dangerous and magical world. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Gandalf\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Gandalf dies. Later, we discover he is reborn. \\n\\n## Patterns and sources of tension\\n--- \\n\\nBeing symbolised by the magician, the wizard, the wise man, a Mentor is a character of mysteries, revelations, inductions. The pattern of the Mentor's relationship with the Hero is one where we find tension and payoff in forbidden knowledge, hidden secrets, and trust. \\n\\nThere are only so many patterns that might reoccur within this symbolic framework. Say, it is remarkable that when the relationship between a Mentor and a Hero is not ultimately a source of tension or of payoff, the Mentor is quickly removed from the story (and the Hero driven faster toward true conflict). \\n\\nFor example: now now, Bilbo, I can't help you slay the dragon because there's this errand I have to run with a necromancer... Frodo, I must meet with Saruman... I've been imprisoned by Saruman... I've fallen into the abyss. Dumbledore is distant with Harry... \\n\\nThe conflict, and tension, is also very *external* to the Hero-Mentor relationship - they are directly pursued by orcs, or demons... Will they be captured? Will they be hurt? \\n\\nBut if you sit two people in a room (or a cave), there better be some sort of conflict and some sort of tension. Otherwise, it may as well be a training montage. \\n\\n## Mysteries and Bran\\n---\\n\\nThere are two mysteries that might have been, or will be, payed off by The Last Greenseer. The first is his identity as Bloodraven, and the second is Jon's parentage. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Why Bloodraven, as a reveal, has no payoff\\n\\n&gt; Bran barely knows Bloodraven is. He has no personal stake in this reveal, and therefore it has no payoff. This can be compared to reveals with real consequence - for example, Luke's true parentage. Bran does not go *Nooo!*, he goes oh, alright. \\n\\n&gt; ##### Why Jon's parentage, as a reveal, has little payoff\\n\\n&gt; While the reveal of Jon's parentage can be assumed to change Bran's perspective of his father and his relationship with his brother, and there is some pathos to this reveal, this reveal is undermined by having very little to do with Bran's *want/need*. It has everything to do with *Jon's* want/need. Jon wants to be a Stark, to know his mother, to be loved, but needs to hold to his oaths and remember the true fight with the Others. Bran wants to walk again, to be a knight, but needs to be a Greenseer. \\n\\n## Signposting and tension\\n---\\n\\nSignposting is a way to build anticipation with an audience. By building anticipation toward an eventual payoff, partnered with uncertainty, you raise the tension. \\n\\nA simple example is (to again use *The Lord of the Rings*) when the Fellowship are fleeing the Balrog. Before we even meet the Balrog, we have heard of the dwarves waking something in the depths, we see goblins flee, we see a growing red light, and we feel the ground shake. \\n\\nIn Bran's story, we see Coldhands being suss (this guy's dead, isn't he?). Then, the Three-Eyed Crow isn't what we expected. Am I drinking blood? Oh, uh, I guess it's tree sap. \\n\\n## The Great Evil\\n---\\n\\nVoldemort. Galbatorix. Lord Vader. Sauron. Thus far, Bran doesn't have much in the way of an antagonist. The Others are like if instead of Sauron, Frodo just had to defeat orcs and Nazgul.\\n\\n## Conclusion and closing notes \\n---\\n\\nThis is not *evidence* for 3EC=/=BR, or Evil BR. If it qualifies as evidence, it is only the most circumstantial. I more intend this as a sort of commentary on, firstly, the idea that those things being true would mean that Bran would have to seek out a *real* mentor. \\n\\nStorytelling is not so linear. It's not a checklist where you need to be trained to get the XP to level up. It's building tension by playing off audience expectations, built by genres and archetypes, to make them ask, what will happen?\\n\\nIf there is no mystery, revelation, or betrayal from either the 3EC or BR, Bran's time in the caves may as well be a montage. They would not make his story a travelogue - they would inject tension and conflict, after, in my opinion, some signposting. \\n\\n* If there is a secret of great personal significance being hidden, what is it, and how could it relate to Bran's character conflict of wanting to be a knight, and needing to be a Greenseer? Bran knows who his parents are, so the default pattern of the genre is eschewed.\\n\\n* If BR is evil, well, that's an obvious conflict that fits with how generally creepy shit has been. \\n\\n* If 3EC=/=BR, that's a reveal that introduces a great deal of conflict.\\n\\nThe only other possibility is that Bloodraven dies, and very soon... which is sort of just a retread of Luwin's death, and Jojen's likely death. \\n\\n&gt; ##### TL;DR \\n&gt; \\n&gt; Bloodraven can't be Bran's dad so he's got to either not be who he seems, have a huge secret that shatters Bran's entire worldview, or die pretty much in chapter 1 of TWOW.\",\n",

Then a crocodile bites off Zolo's hand! Zolo dies falling into a crocodile pit, which Jack later jumps into to the get the emerald back. Given the (albeit twisted and inverted) similarities, it'd be surprising if GRRM didn't have the movie in mind when he named Zollo the Bloody Mummer.\\n\\nWhat other obscure references can you think of?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Now before i get into the question im on the train that the hound is the gravedigger at the quiet isle. To me that was my first thought as reading that chapter and his horse(stranger)being there as well. Then getting on here and seeing that was a popular  theory among the fandom i was sold. I will also say im happy if the hound never comes back and gets a retirement home like ending. Say at peace if u will. Basically the question is tho if the hound does comeback will it possibly be like the show. Will lem lemoncloak for some off the wall reason attack the quiet isle(idk why he wld) bringing the hound out of his semi retirement? Its most like that this has been discussed before but i was just curious and wondering ur guys thoughts. The reason i ask if lem is the possible suspect is bc the show used him instead of just some random men. Its also possible it will be some other men in the book if this is the case.  To me as of right now in the state of the books i dont see why the hound wld comeback. We know the show writers brought him back bc he was well loved through out the fandom. As we all know tho anything is possible and what grrm planned back in the day might be different now. \\n     So basically if grrm plans to bring back the hound is it possible it will happen the same as in the show? If it is possible do u think he gave them idea? Also is there any other theories regarding the hounds comeback that doesnt involve the clegane bowl being the reason?',\n",

       "   'selftext': '\\n\\nOne of the things that bothered me from the Baratheon brothers stand off in ACOK was how poor a negotiator Catelyn was when trying to find a resolution between Stannis and Renly. I know the point of their exchange is how they are polar opposites of each other with Stannis feeling the throne is his duty and Renly and his followers wanting it for glory. Catelyn arrives to this stand off with the unique advantage of not having a dog in either fight yet she does little to broker an actual peace between the brothers.\\nA pact between the brothers here would unite them against the Lannister’s and would have effectively ended the war with Tywin caught between the Starks and the Baratheon/Highgarden alliance and Kings Landing left virtually defenseless.\\nLooking back on it now it’s infuriating how simple the solution was...If Renly agreed to support Stannis on the condition he name him his heir. Stannis wouldn’t like it but naming Renly as his heir over Shireen would actually be following royal precedence (Baelon being chosen over Rhaenys). This would appease the Tyrells as Mace would have a grandson in line for the throne as Stannis is unlikely to have a son with his (now likely barren) Florent wife to oppose Renly‘ claim. \\nRobb would more than likely bend the knee to the brothers and if not he would retreat back behind the neck. The Baratheons would leave him be as they’d be fools to attack the north with winter coming. Leaving enough time to some sort of peace to be found as I think the downfall of the Lannister’s would be enough for Robb and Catelyn. This would also appease Dorne because essentially that’s all they ever wanted aswell. This spells bad news for Dany and fAegon as their now going to have to attempt to invade a fully united Westeros. \\nBut no, Catelyn attempted the “for the sake of the mother that bore you” argument and caused the deaths of thousands. Thanks Catelyn.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Just went through my third reading with tinfoil practically coming out my ears the whole time, and one character that really made it flow was Satin. Some of these theories have been put forward before, but as far as I know not altogether, so here I go. TLDR below.\\n\\n**1. The Oldtown boy found near Gulltown**\\n\\nWhat first interested me about Satin is how he is constantly associated with Oldtown. The first time we properly meet him in ASOS Jon VII, he is introduced as \"the Oldtown boy\", and one of the first things he says is \"I knew a girl in Oldtown who liked to ice her wine.\" In that chapter alone, we get three \"the Oldtown boy\", two \"the boy from Oldtown\" and one \"a boy who\\'d been a whore in Oldtown\". We get it, he\\'s from Oldtown, which is odd, given his first appearance in ACOK Jon I:\\n\\n&gt;This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior...\"Where did Conwy find them?\" \"A lord\\'s dungeon near Gulltown,\" the smith replied. \"A brigand, a barber, a beggar, two orphans, and a boy whore.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is an oversight on GRRM\\'s part, and not just because of Oldtown Satin. Of the five other recruits that came with him, three are eventually named: Hop-Robin and the Fair Isle twins, Arron and Emrick. What were the latter two doing in the Vale? Another mistake? I doubt it, and I also doubt they made their own way there.\\n\\n&gt;\"We met in Gulltown when I had charge of the port.\" (ASOS Sansa VI) “Ser Lyn is a man of simple tastes, my sweetling. All he likes is gold and boys and killing.” (AFFC Alayne I)\\n\\nI think the Fair Isle twins were trafficked into [the Vale](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/2/2d/The_Vale.jpg) by Littlefinger for Lyn Corbray, yet already a few things don\\'t add up with this. Arron and Emrick aren\\'t known as catamites at the Wall, and it seems counterproductive to keep Lyn Corbray\\'s victims in a dungeon near Gulltown when the journey between there and his family seat is cumbersome by land and sea. It would make a lot more sense to sail up the river separating the Fingers from the Vale proper and drop the boys off right by Heart\\'s Home, and that\\'s probably the trail LF uses for this particular trade, yet Conwy found the boys in a lord\\'s dungeon near Gulltown. *Near* Gulltown, Noye said, not *in* Gulltown. The nearest known lord\\'s seat to Gulltown is Runestone, whose lord is familiar with the NW and no friend of LF\\'s, which would make him useful for a certain other \"lord\" known to utilise dungeons and wandering crows.\\n\\n&gt;\"There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm\\'s way...\" (ACOK Tyrion II) \"Varys has informers everywhere. If Sansa Stark should be seen in the Vale, the eunuch will know within a moon\\'s turn...\" (ASOS Sansa VI) “Bronze Yohn...need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.\" (TWOW Alayne I)\\n\\nI think Varys got Yohn Royce to have the boys seized in Gulltown and brought to Runestone. Much like he did with Yoren, Varys made sure Conwy came by, took the six and was on a ship from Yohn\\'s ports before LF could do anything (maybe to make up for losing two possible Lannister bastards, LF gave Lyn [a legitimate golden boy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrek_Lannister)). But why go to such lengths for these kids? Arron and Emrick could just be orphans who happen to be [blonde](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Martyn_Lannister) [twin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywald_Lannister) [westermen](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jason_Lannister), and Satin\\'s just an Oldtown boy, born and raised for carnal joys, who took a random ship going anywhere...right?\\n\\n&gt;\"- my lord, when you should have said m\\'lord. Your tongue betrays your birth with every word you say.\" (ADWD Reek III)\\n\\n**2. Satin\\'s Slip-ups**\\n\\nIce is a rare commodity in the warmer regions of Planetos due to the transport and storage it requires, so is only used by the exceptionally rich and propertied. Jon thinks Satin isn\\'t \"diligent in feeding\" his fire (ADWD, Jon IX), much like Tyrion when living with Tysha because it \"had always been a servant\\'s task\" (ACOK Tyrion XV). Jon says Satin can read and write \"after a fashion\" (ADWD Jon VIII) and is \"all grace\" when dancing (ADWD Jon X). But so what? Maybe the brothel Satin was supposedly born and raised in is fancier than most, where the prostitutes have access to the finer things like ice, servants and tuition in letters and dancing. Satin isn\\'t even the first [literate prostitute](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Marei) we meet in the story, so how does any of this explain anything?\\n\\n&gt;Satin glanced south, frowned. \"You think the scarecrow sentinels scared them off, my lord?\" (ASOS Jon VII) \"It was the priestess we were laughing at,\" said Satin, a lithe and pretty youth who had once been a whore in Oldtown. \"We were only having a jape, my lord.\" (ADWD Jon III)\\n\\nAgain, that alone doesn\\'t prove anything. Chataya and Alayaya call Tyrion \"my lord\", and they\\'re not even ethnically Westerosi (ACOK Tyrion III). Maybe Satin and Yaya were taught by their mothers to speak in a way that befits an establishment catering to rich and mostly highborn clientele.\\n\\n&gt;Jon shooed him off, had Satin start a fire, then sent him out after Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck. \"Bring a flagon of mulled wine as well.\" \"Three cups, m\\'lord?\" (ADWD Jon XIII)\\n\\nAnd that\\'s what convinced me something\\'s up with Satin. I think he\\'s as literate as any noble lad, but when Jon noticed he could read and write at all, Satin feigned only slight literacy, then the smallfolk vernacular, to make up for his slip-ups. But why? Going by the reaction to Satin from the likes of Bowen Marsh and the queen\\'s men, catamites are several social rungs below any kind of bastard, and having a known noble attachment does make life at the Wall easier. So why hide it? Let\\'s look for this possible noble attachment among the houses most associated with Oldtown: The [Hightowers](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_of_Oldtown) obviously come first, followed by the Tyrells, since [its head](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mace_Tyrell) rules the region Oldtown is in and is married to a Hightower, [his uncle](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Moryn_Tyrell) is Lord Commander of Oldtown\\'s City Watch, and [his other uncle](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gormon_Tyrell) and [cousin](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Medwick_Tyrell) are maesters at the Citadel. These families aren\\'t bereft of bastards: Mace\\'s [other other uncle](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Garth_Tyrell) has two he\\'s bringing to KL (AFFC Cersei II), and Maester Walys Flowers was allegedly born of a Hightower girl. So what\\'s the problem? It\\'s not like there\\'s another noble family that has ties to Oldtown, is from a region that has an antagonistic relationship with the Reach, and whose most infamous member in recent times was despised by the Tyrells and possibly fathered \"more bastards than Robert\" (ASOS Jaime VII).\\n\\n&gt;The man lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a lobstered gauntlet in token of submission. (ACOK Tyrion XIV)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...a knight\\'s gauntlet made of lobstered steel. The gauntlet had belonged to a prince, Walgrave claimed, though he could no longer seem to recall which one. (AFFC Prologue)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;So Varys has little birds in the Citadel too. (ASOS Tyrion II)\\n\\n**3. Oberyn\\'s Son**\\n\\nI think Oberyn fathered Satin on a lady of the Reach while he was forging his six links at the Citadel, my favourite candidate being Lazy Leo\\'s mother. It\\'s not hard to imagine Oberyn butting heads with Maester Gormon and having run-ins with Oldtown\\'s CW while there, and him repaying their inhospitality by fucking the Lord Commander\\'s wife. After Oberyn left for the Harrenhal tourney, this lady let her husband know her bun in the oven might come out looking rather Rhoynish. Despite what happened to [the last man who made a fuss about Oberyn giving him horns](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Edgar_Yronwood), Moryn had him seized upon his return. Someone (probably Varys) alerted Doran who, experienced in easing tensions caused by his brother, made a deal with the Oldtown Tyrells: release Oberyn and provide for his child, and the Martells will never speak of what happened, acknowledge the child nor set foot in Oldtown again. Oberyn gave a gauntlet to the Tyrells (which ended up in Walgrave\\'s strongbox for some reason), was freed, boarded *The Feathered Kiss* to collect baby Sarella and sailed off before the birth occurred around the time of the new year, leaving it to an old friend to keep an eye on what turned out to be his two children by his Reach lover: a boy and a girl.\\n\\n&gt;The boy claimed to be eighteen...pretty as a girl with his dark eyes, soft skin, and raven\\'s ringlets. Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up his hands...the boy with the pretty face...*he\\'s quick* (ASOS Jon VII) \"*Got him!*\" Satin shouted...\"*Got him, got him, GOT him!*\" (ASOS Jon VIII)  A lithe and pretty youth (ADWD Jon III) He could smell...the sweet scent Satin combed into his beard (ADWD Jon VII) \"He\\'s quick to learn and very clever...fearless in a fight\" (ADWD Jon VIII)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired... (AGOT Tyrion VIII) *Eighteen, and a whore, but quick of wit, nimble as a cat between the sheets, with large dark eyes and fine black hair*....her pretty face (ACOK Tyrion I) Her dark hair and the smooth cream of her skin...\"My hands won\\'t be soft if I clean ovens and scrape plates all day\"...\"A lady might be afraid,\" said Shae, \"but I\\'m not.\" (ACOK Tyrion X) ...a slender, pretty girl with short dark hair (ACOK Sansa V) \"Hurry...oh, hurry, hurry, I want you in me, in me, in me...My giant, my giant, my giant\"...he could smell the clean fresh scent of her hair... (ASOS Tyrion II) Shae had told her that this Ellaria worshiped some Lysene love goddess. \"She was almost a whore when he found her, m\\'lady,\" her maid confided, \"and now she\\'s near a princess.\" (ASOS Sansa IV) \"My lady,\" said Shae wistfully. (ASOS Tyrion VIII)  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Marwyn...People said that he kept company with whores...down in the undercity, in rat pits and black brothels... (AFFC Prologue)\\n\\n**4. The Sand-Flower Twins**\\n\\nThis is the bit I struggle with the most, because with every possibility comes about ten more with a dozen questions each. Did anyone outside the deal ever find out? If so, who, and how did they react? Who raised them, where and why? Were they raised together? Why would they be separated? Did they know of their parentage and/or of each other? Did one know and not the other? Which one? Did they sneak out of Oldtown of their own accord, or were they made to leave for their own safety, or maybe for a mission? Why would they want to leave? Safety from what? What mission? Who is Moryn Tyrell\\'s wife? Is she alive? Why is there such a massive age gap between Luthor and Leo?\\n\\nThis is the least complicated scenario I could come up with: Satin and Shae\\'s mother is Moryn\\'s second wife, his first having died after Luthor\\'s birth. The twins were declared stillborn and their wet nurse was tasked with passing them off as her own while she was kept on in Moryn\\'s household, since he intended to make a new heir to replace the late Luthor ASAP. After Oberyn crippled Willas (at the 289 [Lannisport Tourney](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Lannisport), perhaps?), Marwyn stepped in to keep his old student\\'s children safe from the incensed Tyrells, bringing them to the Citadel and passing them off as servants, continuing their typical education (as well as commencing some atypical tutelage, him being the Mage and all) in secret. Because of the suspicious Gormon Tyrell, Marwyn couldn\\'t keep them for long, so separated them and moved them around the city for years. At some point, Marwyn told the twins the truth about their parentage and their father\\'s plans for them: while the acknowledged Sand Snakes were being trained to slither into whole spheres of Westerosi society, Oberyn intended to plant his secret Sand Flowers close to two people: Tywin Lannister and Lyn Corbray. Sometime before AGOT, the twins were put on a ship for Gulltown. Shae managed to reach Tywin\\'s camp by the Green Fork, but her brother wasn\\'t as successful. Varys probably thought it best not to kill them while Oberyn was alive, maybe even deciding Shae might be useful, but as a former catamite himself, he likely doesn\\'t appreciate LF\\'s dealings with Lyn, and along with not wanting to have to handle two spies with links to both the Reach and Dorne at the same time, decided to send Satin along with Arron and Emrick to the Wall.\\n\\n**5. A Song of Sand and Flowers**\\n\\nYou’re probably wondering, among other things, why I suspect Moryn Tyrell’s wife to be Satin and Shae\\'s mother, and therefore the maternal half siblings of Lazy Leo Tyrell as well as the paternal half-siblings of Alleras/Sarella Sand. Well prepare to be disappointed, because this is arguably the most tinfoily part of this whole theory.\\n\\nWhen looking for similarities between Satin and Alleras/Sarella beyond their association with Oldtown (same age, good-looking, slim, quick, graceful, smart, dark eyes, dark hair, archers, fond of wine, popular despite the prejudice of some, flying in the face of Westerosi gender roles), I noticed Alleras is introduced with five fellow Citadel students, just as Satin is introduced with five fellow NW recruits. I tried to see if their companions mirrored each other as well, assuming Alleras mirrored Satin and going from there: \"Hopfrog\" Mollander has the same ailment as Hop-Robin. Pate, who considered becoming a barber and lost the use of his legs before dying, can be seen in the greybeard barber leaning on a staff. Armen sounds similar to Arron, and Emrick is as minor a character as Roone and honestly that\\'s all I\\'ve got for those four. So all that\\'s left is Lazy Leo and the grinning brigand loon who fancies himself a warrior, which Leo does fit pretty well, but then again so does Alleras/Sarella, who doesn\\'t fit Satin\\'s first description as \"a foppish youth in soiled satin\" at all...but do you know who does?\\n\\n&gt;Lazy Leo was slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to his shoulder by a rose of jade. The wine he\\'d dribbled down his front had been a robust red, judging from the color of the spots. A lock of his ash-blond hair fell down across one eye. (AFFC Prologue)\\n\\nAlso it\\'d be funny if Leo \"The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between its legs\" Tyrell\\'s own mother had kids with quintessential Dornishman Oberyn Martell, the father of the very person Leo tried to insult with that remark.\\n\\n**6. Satin\\'s Loyalties, Fate and Possible Future Role**\\n\\nSatin is not Jon\\'s enemy, or at the very least, not by the time Ghost returns in ASOS Jon XII. In his last few ADWD chapters, Jon kept Ghost in his chambers, where Satin, his steward and squire, must have spent quite some time, yet we never hear of Ghost harming him. If he was tasked with spying at the Wall by someone (most likely Varys), I\\'d say he, much like Jorah, stopped reporting out of loyalty to the surveilled. Satin fought side-by-side with Jon during the battles of Castle Black and beneath the Wall, and helped him find Ygritte (ASOS Jon VII). Satin is the first mentioned to congratulate Jon on becoming Lord Commander (ASOS Jon XII), and like Sam, chose to say his vows beyond the Wall (ADWD Jon VII) despite previously saying he worshipped the Seven. While Bowen Marsh and others didn\\'t attend the wedding of Alys and Sigorn, Satin not only attended, but provided a \"swirl of lace\" for the bride to wear and danced at the feast (ADWD Jon X). He is disliked by Marsh, which makes it unlikely he played a part in or even knew of the mutiny, and may even be a target himself. He also has quite a few similarities to Jon (which might partly explain why Jon got so defensive when Satin was being ridiculed by Marsh and Cellador): of a background that granted both privilege and hardship, \"the other recruits started out despising him, but he won them over and made friends of them all\" in Jon\\'s own words, went to the stewards and became the personal steward and squire of the Lord Commander (who was betrayed by his own men and murdered in a mutiny).\\n\\nThe last we see of Satin, he and Mully were sent off to help Clydas back to his chambers. Jon and Tormund talk \"for the best part of two hours\", which is then followed by the events that lead to the mutiny. It couldn\\'t have taken Satin and Mully that long to get Clydas back to his chambers, yet they aren\\'t seen again. This is worrying because Ghost tried to bite Mully earlier in the chapter, and Mully was the one who insisted on Jon immediately receiving Clydas with the pink letter, two things that hint at Mully not being Jon\\'s ally. That said, Satin is quick, good with a crossbow, has survived the Wall so far, and if growing up a highborn bastard makes one \"mistrustful\" and \"suspicious\" (ADWD Melisandre I), growing up a highborn bastard raised by Marwyn to be a spy and possible assassin must make one even more so. I think (and hope) in TWOW we\\'ll learn that he survived the mutiny and will inform the survivors (and us) of the real Martell plot (still hoping the \"marry my daughter to the unstable and powerless brother and son of the men who started the war that got my relatives killed to somehow avenge said relatives\" idea was at most a last resort Doran is passing off as Plan A just to stop Arianne screwing anything else up), the possible Tyrell plot, or at least some of Oldtown\\'s secrets, which will likely be an important place in the books to come.\\n\\n**TLDR: Satin and Shae are twins, born to Oberyn and a lady of the Reach. Oberyn tasked Marwyn with training them to help in his vengeance against the murderers of his kin, Satin specifically tasked with going after Lyn Corbray. Varys sent Satin to the Wall so that he wouldn\\'t interfere with his plans. Satin is Jon\\'s ally, and will hopefully survive the mutiny to tell us more about the Martells, the Tyrells and Oldtown.**',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I've been looking through this subreddit recently and nobody has asked how the books may go down compared too the show or at least if the show is anything to go by, there has been a lot about when on earth George will finish the books, but nothing on what will go down? so today I wanted to ask, how will the books play out compared to the show? but more importantly, will they have different endings? I personally I think the endings the same or at least similar. Yes there will be differences (I think both Arya and Sansa's fate will be VERY different, With Arya becoming Queen in the North and Sansa ruling the Vale), Euron will probably be the De-facto leader of the White Walkers (or at least be helping them in some other way), other books characters will be involved obviously, And I got a hunch Young Griff may be Jon's twin. But for the most part the endings will be the same or at least very similar to one another, With both Dany AND Cersei going mad (or maybe Cersei will have some sort of redemption arc in the books, I highly doubt it but who knows), Jon putting down Dany and going to the truth north (though in the books I think it will be willingly on his own terms), and Bran becoming king. Weather or not Tyrion is his hand or not I am not sure.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '***TLDR; I am writing a complete overhaul of The Game of Thrones TV series, starting from season one.***\\n\\nWith his out of the way, I thought I\\\\`d ask you guys for a piece of advice:\\n\\nVery early on I have to make a decision, which characters to introduce, develop and tie to the plot in later seasons:\\n\\nJeyne Poole or Ros the Prostitute.\\n\\nJeyne Poole is in Got and she is briefly seen near Sansa in the first episode, but never appears or mentioned ever again. She can be safely called a book-only character, as she is not even given a name in the show. This seems weird as she plays a vital role in later books. Even if you give showrunners a pass, because the book she is featured the most in, A dance with dragons, had not been released while season one was in production, in aSoS she appears as Fake Arya, which seems like an awfully important detail to omit. Her being the fake Stark girl is a plot point that still provides a lot of speculation on how the northern plotline is going to progress.\\n\\nRos, on the other hand, is a show-only character. She is a prostitute in Winterfell and seems to be familiar and tied in with several characters, among which are Robb, Jon, Tyrion, and of course Theon. She is seemingly introduced as sexposition machine, and a POV character to be placed in brothels and sex scenes. However, she is given quite a bit of screen time and is involved in the intrigues of a game of thrones. She repeatedly meets Sansa and Tyrion and even encounters Varys. She gets progressively involved until Littlefinger discovers that she had been spying on him for Varys. She is given to Joffrey to be tortured to death, and thus her story ends.\\n\\nJeyne is a meek, naïve young girl that is captured and brutally abused, raped and tortured off-screen. She is completely broken and helpless at the hands of sadists like Ramsay who abuses her and ***forces his dogs on her,*** and Littlefinger, who just ***keeps her as a sex slave*** until she is useful to him to advance his goals. Horrible fate, and it does not seem to be going well for her.\\n\\nRos, on the other hand, is ambitious and outgoing. She laughs and pokes fun at the noble she sleeps with and actively uses it to advance herself. She by her own volition undertakes a journey to King\\\\`s landing to earn more money off her beauty, and she actively engages more in more in the intrigues of higher-ups placing herself right in the middle of action completely on her own initiative. This is what gets her killed in the end. She is briefly tortured; however, it barely compares to the prolonged horrors that Jeyne is going through.\\n\\nAt first glance, there is very little overlap between the two characters, both plot-wise and character-wise. However, it doesn\\\\`t take a huge leap to see how similar their plotlines are:\\n\\n* · Both know characters in Winterfell, and have access to somewhat privileged information about the nobles,\\n* · Their stories are closely related to sex and abuse by Littlefinger\\\\`s orders. Having been held against their will by Baelish is true for both of them.\\n* · And finally, they are very close to Sansa, at one point or another.\\n\\nAnd that\\\\`s exactly what I am trying to choose while writing my own autistic overhaul of the show: Which one is the better character to keep and develop?\\n\\nSo far, the pros of each one are as follows:\\n\\n**JEYNE**\\n\\n***Pros***\\n\\n* · Fake Arya makes a lot more sense than fake Sansa, as the latter is wanted for regicide, and Boltons don\\\\`t seem to be going against the crown for now. Marrying Sansa to Ramsay is a weird political move.\\n* · Jeyne Poole would be on a perfect trajectory to be sent to Braavos after she gets to the Wall to find Jon Snow dead. Once she gets there meeting the real Arya can lead to a lot of dramatic moments and be the reason why Arya decides to return to her true self.\\n* · Jeyne Poole can be the bully that Arya dislikes in the first season, thus making their reunion tense, now that Arya is a killer that thinks that just killing people, they don\\\\`t like is completely fine. This can be a turn heel moment, where up until now Arya was killing people the audience dislikes, but her killing Jeyne is ruthless, and would be a dark turn for Arya.\\n* · She can effectively replace Ros\\\\`s POV and have Littlefinger personally taking part in mentally breaking her. He can monologue to her about his goals, for more exposition.\\n\\n***Cons:***\\n\\n* · Her time as Fake Arya in Winterfell can be underwhelming as Theon and Jeyne don\\\\`t really share a history together, and although their character will gasp upon recognizing each other, it will mean very little for the viewer, as there is no time for them to have any develop any chemistry before Jeyne leaves with Sansa for King\\\\`s Landing in season one.\\n* · While we can show her being tormented the same way we see Theon, she does not play as big of a role, and this can be viewed as torture porn, just for the sake of shock value.\\n* · Captive Jeyne can\\\\`t replace Ros filling in for Chataya and Alayaya, therefore, they or a stand-in characters need to be introduced.\\n* · The fight between Brienne and the Hound would be impossible, as she would not think that Arya in Winterfell Is real after seeing and losing an actual Arya just a couple of days ago.\\n\\n**pROS**\\n\\n* · She is connected through the physical relationships to several characters and can be effectively paced in different circumstances. It makes sense for her to be privy to different events without seeming random. She could interact reasonably interact with Theon, Tyrion, Littlefinger, Varys, Shae, and Sansa, and then captured by Littlefinger and used for advancing the Northern plot, when he realizes how much she knows.\\n* · She has an actual sexual history with Theon. She is most likely his first woman. Their similarities would make their reunion a dark twist of fate, where they both leave Winterfell arrogant, determined, and self-assured and come back as broken prisoners, devoid of their real identity, tortured and mutilated. Their escape can be mutually liberating.\\n* · She would be a more important character with an actual journey than Jeyne, who would have been somewhat of a plot device.\\n* · She would be one of the few low-born characters in the story, which is appreciated.\\n\\n***Cons***\\n\\n* · Choosing this plot would render Arya meeting her in Braavos useless, as it is less shocking for Arya to meet someone claiming to be Sansa, only to find out that is not someone that she really knows, than it is for Arya to meet herself, only to discover it was her childhood bully. The latter could really mess someone up, while the former is not that impressive. Possibly, it would require a different plot for both Arya and Ros and a different, less compelling reason for Arya to leave House of Black and white.\\n* · Possible outcry about Ros being a strong female character brought down to the victim level, similar as it was with Sansa? However, she could have more agency than Jeyne(As Sansa, in the tv show), and not be completely broken.\\n\\n***Possible solution:***\\n\\n**An amalgamation of two:**\\n\\nJeyne stays at Winterfell and continues interacting with Theon, showing some sort of affection for him, but ultimately disregarding him as “a ward”. When Theon takes back Winterfell, he forces himself on her, making her his bed maid. After Ramsay captures Winterfell, her fate is a mystery until she is revealed as “Arya”. In this scenario, Littlefinger is not connected to this plot at all, and it is all 100% percent Ramsay\\\\`s idea.\\n\\nThe obvious problem is, of course, Theon raping 15-16-year-old girl, who is supposed to be pretending to be a 13-14-year-old. This will rustle a lot of jimmies and might make Theon even more disliked. Additionally, this will both diminish Osha\\\\`s role in season 2 and will invoke the need of introducing new characters for King\\\\`s landing brothel scenes. And it doesn’t really solve the Arya in Braavos problem – this version of Jeyne will have a very little on-screen history with Arya making their meeting underwhelming.\\n\\n**So,**\\n\\nMy question is what do you guys think would be better for this hypothetical story? Jeyne, Ros, the amalgamation of two? If Ros, then what would you do with her character after she and Theon escape? What would be your reason for Arya coming back from Braavos?\\n\\nIf Jeyne, how would you improve the impact of her meeting Theon?\\n\\nIf amalgamation, then how would you combine/change those characters? Maybe Jeyne is a willing accomplice to Ramsay, like Myranda in the show?\\n\\nOpinions would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'In this series I will take a look at notorious/important places beyond the wall if this post is popular. \\n\\nThenn is far to the north of the Wall. AWOIAF describes it as a high mountain valley hidden in the peaks of the northern Frostfangs. \\n\\nThenn is described as warmer and more fertile than the rest of the lands beyond the Wall. The inhabitants consider themselves the last of the First Men. Unlike the rest of the free folk the Thenns have lords, laws, and a set leader (Magnar). \\n\\nThey are notorious for being clad in bronze. \\nBut two questions, how is this possible that Thenn is so warm? And, why are they the only bronze clad warriors north of the Wall? \\n\\nOne theory answers both of these questions. Thenn, like the wall and the cave of the 3ER/3EC, is protected by a magical barrier to keep the Others and the cold out. This also explains the lack of bronze elsewhere beyond the wall because other wildlings have probably tried to attack Thenn for the bronze. So they protect the bronze mines, while the magical barriers don’t keep the wildlings out they slow them down.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"In ADWD, Jon's stabbing led by Bowen Marsh is the culmination of a set of complex, heartbreaking circumstances. Jon deciding to ride on Winterfell is understandable. The Pink Letter threatens both the Watch and his family, so Jon can either challenge Ramsay or give into his horrible demands. He doesn't even command the Watch to fight with him, so the overall neutrality of the Night's Watch is upheld to an extent. But Marsh and the others killing Jon to prevent him from fighting Ramsay is also understandable. Jon wants to directly challenge a great lord of the North, with a mostly wilding army. The Lord Commander leading a mostly wilding army to the heart of the North to take back Winterfell is not a good look for the Night's Watch, and it endangers thousands of Black Brothers and wilding women and children. You can sympathize with the mutineers even more when you learn that they're crying as they stab Jon. Bowen and the rest clearly didn't want it to come to this. In the show, Jon is killed because the Night's Watch hates the free folk and Alliser Thorne wants to be Lord Commander. That's it. It went from a complex situation in the books to a boiled down situation in the show led by a one dimensional villain.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'It’s a common theory that Stonheart will receive mercy from Arya, because mercy is thematically connected to both of them, Arya spends a chapter in TWOW under the name Mercy, while UnCat is nicknamed Mother Merciless. It was Arya who started the gears that led to Catelyn’s resurrection, it seems fitting she is the one to end it too. And it would also be a lesson to Arya to let go of her list sidequest. These and more are the reasons why a part of the fandom wants this to happen. \\n\\nIt is also common among the fandom to speculate how would Arya get out of her relationship with the Faceless Men. Now, there’s quite a lot of people who think she’ll reach high enough in their ranks it will become impossible to change her mind from, so she’ll desert from them, and they’ll hunt her until she is dead. That’s a possibility and it’s a fine theory on its own. I propose a different one though: Stoneheart’s mercy is Arya’s payment for her freedom. \\n\\nAs people on Westeros.org forums have noted, [Arya’s arc is repeating chapter-by-chapter](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/155285-trying-to-make-sense-of-parallels-arya’s-story-repeats/&amp;amp;tab=comments#comment-8404496). I suggest to give that thread a read before continuing because the rest of the theory is founded on those observations. Also, to add more to OP at westeros.org, Mercy is the equivalent of Arya I in ACOK, in both chapters a friend older in age (Gendry/Daena) tries to protect Arry/Mercy from people who might harm her (wannabe bully Hot Pie bless his heart/Raff the Sweetling) but in both cases Arya has the upper hand (she kicks Hot Pie’s ass/kills Raff the Sweetling) showing she is the one to really fear. Also, Lommy is the indirect instigator in both cases. Like the analysis in the link shows, GRRM is repeating her story because he wants to show her growth, she reacts differently now even though the situations have parallels, she used to be angry and hot-blooded, now she is calm and collected. \\n\\nKnowing that Arya’s arc is repeating, let’s go back to one of her most important moments in the past: a major part of her arc in ACOK is the deal she made with Jaqen: 3 deaths she stole from The Red God/R’hllor must be given back. Now, some people have questioned if this is truly a FM policy or is Jaqen working alone, because he is working under a different god here, and I don’t know what’s unusual about this. The Faceless Men explained they serve all gods because they believe every god in every culture is just a different face of the Many-Faced God, and that all gods are a representation of death. That includes R’hllor, or the weirwood trees which Jaqen told Arya to not mock. It’s explicit in the books. \\n\\n&gt; “Thirty different gods stood along the walls, surrounded by their little lights. The Weeping Woman was the favorite of old women, Arya saw; rich men preferred the Lion of Night, poor men the Hooded Wayfarer. Soldiers lit candles to Bakkalon, the Pale Child, sailors to the Moon-Pale Maiden and the Merling King. The Stranger had his shrine as well, though hardly anyone ever came to him. Most of the time only a single candle stood flickering at his feet. The kindly man said it did not matter. \"He has many faces, and many ears to hear.\" - Arya II, AFFC\\n\\n&gt;  \"The Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,\" the kindly man taught her, \"but Braavos is the bastard child who ran away from home. We are a mongrel folk, the sons of slaves and whores and thieves. Our forebears came from half a hundred lands to this place of refuge, to escape the dragonlords who had enslaved them. Half a hundred gods came with them, but there is one god all of them shared in common.\"\\n\\n&gt; \"Him of Many Faces.\"\\n\\n&gt; \"And many names,\" - Cat of the Canals, AFFC\\n\\nR’hllor is a god of death as much as a god of light. He is perfectly in line with FM philosophy. Which leads us to this deal:\\n\\n&gt; \"The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.\" - Arya VII, ACOK\\n\\nThis isn’t outside of FM modus operandi either, we know FM adjust their prices depending on the inquirers’ ability to pay. They are known to be steep, but people of all social classes can afford their services. In fact, many seek their services for gentle deaths, and the payment they offer is their faces and a bonus of whatever they have in their body, coins, jewlery etc. We know this because it’s Arya’s duty in The Blind Girl to clean their bodies and prepare them. We also know the face of the Ugly Girl that Arya took was once one of those who seeked the gift of mercy in the House of Black and White. We also know from the Waif’s backstory that she was part of the price her father paid to have her stepmother killed. \\n\\n&gt; I was born the only child of an ancient House, my noble father\\'s heir,\" the waif replied. \"My mother died when I was little, I have no memory of her. When I was six my father wed again. His new wife treated me kindly until she gave birth to a daughter of her own. Then it was her wish that I should die, so her own blood might inherit my father\\'s wealth. She should have sought the favor of the Many-Faced God, but she could not bear the sacrifice he would ask of her. Instead, she thought to poison me herself. It left me as you see me now, but I did not die. When the healers in the House of the Red Hands told my father what she had done, he came here and made sacrifice, offering up all his wealth and me. Him of Many Faces heard his prayer. I was brought to the temple to serve, and my father\\'s wife received the gift.\" - Cat of the Canals, AFFC\\n\\nFM deal with people’s lives when necessary, so it perfectly plausible that Arya can make a deal with them if she wants to leave them. And surely, an undead woman must be of some value to them. Especially one that was resurrected because Arya wanted her to. Not only Arya warged Nymeria to pull out her mother’s body out of the river, Beric resurrected Catelyn because he promised to help a little girl looking for mother, on his honor as a knight:\\n\\n&gt; I do not have the power to give you back your father, no more than Thoros does, but I can at least see that you are returned safely to your mother\\'s arms.\"\\n\\n&gt; \"Do you swear?\" she asked him. Yoren had promised to take her home too, only he\\'d gotten killed instead.\\n\\n&gt; \"On my honor as a knight,\" the lightning lord said solemnly. - Arya VII, ASOS\\n\\nThat’s why he didn’t listen to Thoros and went and resurrected her himself, he had a promise to keep her:\\n\\n&gt; Harwin begged me to give her the kiss of life, but it had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord Beric put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And... she rose. May the Lord of Light protect us. She rose. - Brienne VIII, AFFC\\n\\nAnd what Catelyn wanted the most when she was alive was to save her daughters. Maybe she can do it this way. And she’ll receive mercy too, a gentle death this time around. Mercy for Catelyn, and freedom for Arya.',\n",

And the wild fire thing of course could still happen, but the trigger wouldn\\'t be Dany\\'s fault.\\n\\nI\\'m saying this because it\\'s clear Bran will have a big say in the story (it\\'s hinted that he might become \"king\", but maybe that\\'s just in the sense that he can control and order anyone to do anything), and that would be a way to link the storylines in the north and south.\\n\\nOf course I have no evidence for this. But it would be cool, and quite sad for Daenerys to go out like that tbh.',\n",

As well as this, all the other characters from the books and show exist too, and their actions will stay the same if you don't do anything to change them (e.g. the WotF will still happen if you don't do anything).

I prefer that the Dreadfort to be literally destroyed as a reminder of what treachery will do and to assert strength in not reminding everyone what will happen when a House goes extinct through back stabbing and pretty much going against the North.\\n\\nFor the lands I would split between whatever loyal vassels help House Stark reclaim the Northern Kingdom which will likely be Umber/Mormonts/Hornwood - Although House Hornwood is partially extinct Laurance Snow could be legitimised to restore House Hornwood and would be vengeance for what House Bolton did to Hornwood. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think?\",\n",

And this is what makes the Starks different fundamentally than the Lannisters, or say Baratheons-who as opposed to having healthy and supportive familial relationships are at each other\\'s throats at various times. Family and all that. But what happens when Spring starts and winter ends? Does the pack go its separate ways? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWith the show ending in the back of our heads, what will the \"pack separating\" look like? \\n\\nYou may ask, \"Why the pack would never separate surely?\" Well the Stark kids are going down different roads in adulthood-whatever those may be, kingship, ladyship, exile and so on. \\n\\nWe will get a LOTR esque \"breaking of the fellowship\" scene, in ADOS? Assuming it comes out-anything that looks like the show-where the Starks being adults and winter(as well as their enemies gone), say their final goodbyes and head off in their separate ways? \\n\\nPersonally I don\\'t mind this-just because families stick together doesn\\'t mean they all stick in the same house(as an aside Arya keeping Needle was a wonderful way of showing her undying love for her family-even if D&amp;D criminally misunderstood that). \\n\\nBut with that in mind, what will the \"Stark family separation\" at the end of Dream look like?

       "   'selftext': 'Much has been said about Martin writing morally grey characters, but the Ned is often pointed to as an anomaly - aside from the lie about Jon’s parentage, which is yet still deeply honorable in its way if he’s protecting Rhaegar and Lyanna’s child from being murdered, the dude is sparkling clean. \\n\\nBut wait. There does seem to be another specter of his past for which he seems guilty - his defeat of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. And he seems to shy away from any glory associated with defeating the most badass, chivalrous, and skilled knight in all the land, maybe the fuckin’ universe? \\n\\nWhen Ned is experiencing a fever dream here is how his companions are described : \\n\\n&gt;Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man’s memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only **shadows, grey wraiths** on horses made of mist.\\n\\n— Eddard, AGOT \\n\\nAnd here’s how the three Kings Guard at the Tower of Joy are described : \\n\\n&gt;Yet these were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; **their faces burned clear**, even now.\\n\\n— Eddard, AGOT \\n\\nThe difference couldn’t be more clear, like night and day, shadow and light - his companions are given dark symbolism and his opponents are “burning clear” and of course white and bright. \\n\\nWe learn elsewhere that Howland knows how to fight with a net :\\n\\n&gt;”I never knew anyone who fought with a net before,” he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears. “Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting?”  \\n“My father taught me. We have no knights at Greywater. No master-at-arms, and no maester.”\\n\\n— Bran, ACOK\\n\\nAnd we also learn from Bran that Ned was no match for Dayne : \\n\\n&gt;”The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed.” **Father had gotten sad then**, and he would say no more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant.\\n\\n— Bran, ACOK\\n\\nSo do we Bran... So do we, because I think that remorseful, suddenly quiet Eddard would have said this if he was willing to finally confess : \\n\\nNed killed Arthur Dayne while he was tied up in Howland Reed’s net, his skill with a sword rendered moot. \\n\\nWe know Reed taught Meera her net fighting skills so there’s that established already, we know Ned claims Dayne would have killed him but for Reed, and the more and more I think about his fever dream, and how he doesn’t want to take any glory or whatever for having defeated the greatest, most chivalrous knight in the universe (I mean dude is worshiped like Jesus both in the books and by the fandom), in fact he’s remorseful about it, the more I think this may have been what went down. And I’d like to reiterate the symbolism of his companions being described as wraiths or shadows, while the KG in the dream are untainted and clear. \\n\\nOn that subject a special note - one could say that his companions are wraiths because they’re dead but there’s a big hole in that notion...\\n\\nHowland is alive. \\n\\nThe killing of a defenseless Dayne is motivated by Ned’s rush to “rescue” Lyanna, and returning Dawn and his guilt of sorts is well motivated now as well, in addition to Ashara killing herself (if she did in fact) with the news of what happened. The Daynes don’t worship Ned after this, but they at least respect him for his actions thereafter. \\n\\nIt all ties together rather decently, and we now have a very black mark on Ned’s honor, we have now found him to be morally grey as well.',\n",

The theory goes like this: Bronn is the Last Lord of Castamere. There are several reasons this doesn\\'t work. If we make Bronn the oldest age possible, he\\'s still six years younger. Not to mention, the Last Lord is dead. He was killed by Ser Amory Lorch. \"But he might not have actually died, like fAegon!\" Still impossible. Once again, we come back to age. Bronn was born in 264 AC at the *earliest.* The Last Lord was born in *258 AC.* So, in conclusion, Bronn is too young to be the Last Lord, not to mention the Last Lord\\'s demise at the hands of Ser Amory Lorch.',\n",

The overarching story is said to be inspired by the conflict in English History that has been dubbed the War of the Roses. But Martin took inspiration from numerous other historical events and figures, as he has mentioned that the idea of the Wall came from Hadrian’s Wall. In a fantasy series where numerous characters and events are directly inspired by figures from the War of the Roses, Martin also has stated that his inspiration for Stannis Baratheon was Tiberius Caesar, the second Emperor of Rome. (Martin)\\n\\nTiberius Julius Caesar Claudianus was the second Emperor of Rome. He was adopted by the first Emperor, and founder of the Roman Empire, Caesar Augustus (once known as Octavian). Tiberius ruled Rome for 23 years and notably was the ruler of the Empire during the time of Jesus. Tiberius was regarded by most contemporary historians as a tyrant, with Suetonius accusing him of pedophilia and randomly executing people. Yet the Roman Historians at the same time struggled with Tiberius as they saw he was more than his despotic successor, Caligula. Even though most of the major sources of history are not flattering towards Tiberius as a man, they saw that he did accomplish good things for Rome. Tiberius was a great general in his youth as he conquered the Alps, he ended the rebellion in Illyria and helped pacify Germania and Gaul. As Emperor, Tiberius reign was mostly peaceful save for reckless campaigning by his nephew Germanicus. (Barrett) Tiberius left the Empire enormously wealthy, and while never engaging in major infrastructure or providing great entertainment, he also was famous for being vigilant on corruption and excess in the provinces. Cassius Dio best encapsulates this ambivalence with his summation: “Tiberius, who possessed a great many virtues and a great many vices, and followed each set in turn as if the other did not exist” (*Roman History*). The complexity of Tiberius would form the inspiration for the most popular presentation of Tiberius that was Martin’s primary inspiration for Stannis Baratheon.\\n\\nAuthor Robert Graves claims to have been fascinated by the maligned and forgotten Emperor Claudius after translating Suetonius’ *Twelve Caesars* in English. Later Claudius appeared to Graves in a dream, demanding that Graves tell his true story. (I, Claudius: The Epic That Never  Was) Graves obliged the Emperor, and wrote the novels *I, Claudius* and *Claudius the God*. The duology is written as an autobiography by Claudius, a historian and black sheep of the Imperial Family. Claudius uses his disabilities to his advantage to survive the intrigue of his family until he surprisingly becomes the Emperor of Rome and rules the Empire well. The duology is one of the most popular works of historical fiction and literature in the 20th Century. The books were adapted to a beloved TV miniseries that brought new interest in Rome and rehabilitated Claudius. \\n\\nThe TV Series was created in 1976, written by Jack Pulman and directed by Herbert Wise*. I, Claudius* featured an all-star cast and received numerous awards. The greatest of praise would go to scene stealers Sian Philips as the wicked Livia and John Hurt as the mad Caligula. Yet, George RR Martin took notice of George Baker’s performance of Tiberius Caesar. Baker’s performance and role is arguably much harder than the magnificent flat characters in *I, Claudius*. Baker’s Tiberius is a man who slowly declines from a good man to a bitter tyrant. Baker’s Tiberius is forced into being Emperor, something he ironically has no interest in. Tiberius is a mix of ambivalence and contradiction, as he says that he does not want to be Emperor, and yet he all but begs to be loved first by Augustus, and later the people. Clearly underneath it all, Tiberius craves his mother’s love. Tiberius is a complex character. He is ultimately a sympathetic and even tragic character (sympathy is not empathy), which is impressive considering the monstrous things Tiberius does by the end of the series. He shares his comic sympathy to an old and broken Claudius in a hallucination: “It wasn’t worth it, was it? I could have told you that.” (Episode 12.*Old King Log*) It’s a fitting summation of Tiberius journey, a journey which inspired one of Martin’s most popular characters, Stannis.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[The One True King and his Heir](https://preview.redd.it/rupi4r5nltc41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c30ee21d500c1c10155cb5eb0864ffa47c06ef6)\\n\\n**Broken Pride—**\\n\\nTiberius Caesar is not a well-known figure in the world, even with his mention in the Bible\\\\[1\\\\] (to be fair they only refer to him as “Caesar” in the Bible). But Martin latched onto the character of the forgotten and unsung member of a royal family as he created Stannis Baratheon. Stannis is the middle of three brothers, with his older brother Robert becoming King. Like Tiberius, Stannis constantly feels as though he has been not given his proper credit for what he has done for the Realm. Stannis has Tiberius same mixture of pride, entitlement, moral rigidity and justified outrage. Martin's influence from Baker’s Tiberius is clear from Stannis’ debut in *A Clash of Kings*. Stannis delivers a scathing monologue to his father-figure Maester Cressen of how he has been unappreciated and insulted numerous times by his brother King Robert:\\n\\n&gt;Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure. Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way he treated me. I held Storm’s End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them. (Prologue)\\n\\nCompare that to Tiberius angrily decrying the injustices done to him to his mother:\\n\\n&gt;Well don’t bother on my account! I’m sick of it! The gods know I’ve done my best! He never liked me, never! Thirty years I’ve run his errands for him. I’ve fought on his bloody frontiers, collected his taxes! He never once put his arm around me and said, ‘Thank you. What would I have done without you?’ Now he sends me off to Illyricum without even planning a farewell dinner. Not even a goodbye. Just, ‘Get on your horse and ride.’ Well, damn him! I’ve retired once and I can retire again! Let his precious grandson run his empire for him! I’m sick to death of it! (Episode 4.*Poison is Queen*)\\n\\nBoth speeches magnificently encapsulate the characters. Both characters are deeply bitter that for all their hard work and sacrifice, they are not loved. They are aware of this and do not delude themselves. Instead they impotently lash out at those that are loved and decry their fate. \\n\\nTiberius and Stannis both share a toxic sense of pride and entitlement. They spend large amounts of time venting their frustrations at the perceived injustices made against them. Tiberius lashes out at constantly being given “errands” that he finds tedious and beneath him by Augustus. Similarly Stannis goes out of his way to list the hard work he has done that has gone unsung by his brother. In both monologues lies an implicit desperation. Stannis desperately wants his brother’s approval as Tiberius desperately wants Augustus’. When someone insists upon something it may stem from the latent belief that it is not true. Men who vehemently insist that they deserve something is perhaps because they secretly believe they do not. Tiberius and Stannis insist that they are owed respect and love. But deep down they have been so beaten by their lack of appreciation, they seem to truly believe that they are not worthy of it. Tiberius defeated tone in his speech suggests that he ultimately acknowledges that he will never get the approval of Augustus. Stannis defensively and dismissively mentioning that Robert was enraged that he “allowed” Viserys and the babe Daenerys escape reveals that Robert’s critique forever scarred Stannis. Stannis could never forget Robert’s disappointment in him. This suggests that Stannis secretly believed that Robert was right about him. Stannis will never admit it to himself, but he thinks he did nothing to earn Robert’s thanks. \\n\\nStannis refused to declare Robert as his “beloved brother”. Outwardly Stannis is dismissive and bitter about Robert. But his raw emotions about his brother clearly underline a deep emotional relationship. As is often said, “the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference.” While Renly was content to be in Robert’s shadow and be his sycophant, Stannis desperately wanted to escape it and have his own legacy. Renly is genuinely indifferent about Robert beyond what his legacy can do for Renly’s gain. Stannis in contrast is clearly affected by Robert’s death and how he never resolved his issues with his brother. Underneath his outward rage, Stannis clearly idolized his brother Robert. As Melissandre asserts Stannis’ destiny as the Lord’s chosen, Stannis states that Robert should have been the Lord’s chosen. Stannis compares most of his actions and behavior to Robert’s signaling his deep-seated insecurities and struggles. The same struggles felt by Tiberius Caesar. \\n\\nWe see the same volatile explosions from Tiberius about his mother, Livia. He whines about her ambitions for him, but he goes along with her schemes because he secretly wants her approval. Tiberius divorces the woman he loves to appease his mother’s ambitions. Tiberius’ rages at his mother for his unpopularity outwardly trying to place it as misdirected hate for her. George Baker cited his personal favorite moment for *I, Claudius* was Tiberius moment of triumph over Livia in Episode 5 “Some Justice”. Trapped in a corner, Livia begs Tiberius to acquit an obviously guilty couple of murder to avoid them incriminating Livia. Tiberius proudly refuses, and in his moment of angry vengeance declares that he will excuse Livia “on the grounds of mental incompetence, brought on by extreme old age!” But even this moment of “defeating” his mother, Tiberius still is obsessed with gaining her approval. Their final scene together rattles him to demand his astrologer discover when she will die. Tiberius and Stannis are proud men who secretly desire to be loved, but they also implicitly feel that they do not deserve love. This happens because the figures they crave approval from blithely ignore their attempts to earn their approval.\\n\\nIn *A Storm of Swords* when confronted about Stannis’ constant referral of following the law, Davos Seaworth points out that he supported his brother against his lawful King. Stannis pauses and reflects that it was a difficult decision. A running theme in *A Song of Ice and Fire* presented by Maester Aemon in *A Game of Thrones* is the dilemma of choosing between love and duty. Stannis just like Ned and many characters did choose love as he supported Robert. Robert in his brazen cavalier attitude simply assumed that Stannis would support Robert and never considered how difficult it was for the rigid and rightful Stannis to support a rebel. That Stannis chose Robert over his King is the greatest demonstration of Stannis’ true love and loyalty to Robert. Stannis was a staunch moralist who once proposed outlawing prostitution, he also is a firm believer in the law demonstrated by chopping off Davos Seaworth’s fingers for his years as a smuggler. While Stannis does recognize good deeds of Davos, he refuses to forget that Davos was a criminal for years. He states his rigidity, “A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. You were a hero and a smuggler.” This reveals how cerebral Stannis is, and how unlike his impulsive brother he weighs all his decisions. Stannis refuses to be blindsided by a good deed, nor is he ungrateful for Davos’ actions. Stannis actions towards Davos reveal Stannis’ complexity and should be demonstrative even to someone as headstrong as Robert at how significant Stannis’ decision to support Robert was. But Robert was too preoccupied with the Rebellion and his vices to recognize Stannis’ monumental decision and display of love. This obliviousness deeply impacted Stannis and is like the coldness between Augustus and Tiberius.\\n\\nHistorians and dramatists are always fascinated by the relationship of the real-life relationship between Augustus and Tiberius. Historians have made note of key phrases from several documents and purported remarks that reveal that Augustus clearly was disappointed in Tiberius. One of Augustus’ purported last words were pitying that Rome would having to be ruled by Tiberius. Tiberius would have likely been regarded as a mediocre if positive Emperor had he not been the successor of the most beloved and impactful Roman of all-time. Robert Graves and the creators of the TV series capture the tense relationship of Tiberius and Augustus. In one of their first scenes together, Augustus gives Tiberius bland support and instructions. The scene perfectly captures their relationship as Tiberius recognizes that Augustus simply does not like him. Augustus expresses his confusion about Tiberius to Tiberius’ brother Drusus, and routinely says that he does not want Tiberius as his heir. Each time the succession is brought up Augustus bluntly says that “I never liked \\\\[Tiberius\\\\].” Augustus is not blind to Tiberius’ uses, and is irate when Tiberius asks to retire. But Augustus never wants Tiberius to be anything more than a useful ally. This lack of appreciation enrages Tiberius as he is understandably hurt that Augustus does not like him. Tiberius fights long, bloody and miserable campaigns for Augustus, he serves in the courts and the Senate for Augustus. Tiberius does everything that Augustus asks of him and performs commendably. But Augustus does not acknowledge the difficulty of these tasks, he simply shrugs and greets Tiberius with benign indifference. Augustus inability to relate to Tiberius is even more galling because Augustus favors men who have done far less for him, such as the temperamental rake Postumus Agrippa or the young golden-boy Germanicus. This cold reception deeply affects Tiberius just as it affects Stannis leading to their tragedy.\\n\\nStannis and Tiberius are characters defined by a hard exterior that masks a fragile soul. Both men have done everything that can be reasonably expected to earn the affection of a powerful figure. But neither receives the love they crave. This wounds them to the point of bitterness as they slowly let their demons consume them. Their justness and fairness are tarnished as they bitterly accept that they shall not be loved. The key difference is that there is hope for as much redemption and love as is possible for Stannis unlike Tiberius. Tiberius soon neglects Rome as he broods and descends into depravity in *I, Claudius*. In contrast, Stannis chooses to serve the Realm over his right to the throne when he goes north to confront the Others. His actions lead to tense negotiations with Jon Snow as he tries to consolidate power while planning on confronting the true enemy in the North. His journey as of now is incomplete. While the HBO adaptation of the series offers suggestions on some of the endpoints, Stannis has become a man who has chosen duty over love. But Martin will have to reveal what that means for Westeros. Will this lead to his salvation or damnation? Tiberius let his demons consume him, he became a tyrant and met a pathetic and deserved end.

       "   'selftext': 'Reading through the post about Cersei\\'s failed seduction on Ned, I came across a theory that suggested Ned and Ashara had a bastard child. Digging through this rabbit hole I\\'ve seen plenty of theories of the true parentage of characters. \\n\\nThis gets me thinking. Why do the Daynes have purple eyes? They must have some type of Valerian blood to have inherited the eye color. So what if the Daynes are the true Targaryens and the Targaryens we\\'re given are actually Blackfyres or some type of imposters? There\\'s a lot of mystery surrounding the house of Dayne. Arthur and Ashara both supposedly died, but neither body was ever found. They have some connection to Ned from the tournament at Harrenhal and the tower of joy. It seems weird that Ned is rumored to have been in love with Ashara and it\\'s said to have killed Arthur, who was touted as the best swordsman the seven kingdoms have ever seen. Not to mention, he brings Dawn to Starfall, but not Arthur\\'s bones. He supposedly breaks Ashara\\'s heart and causes her to kill herself. Yet the house of Dayne still has enough love for Ned that they name Edric after him. This is quite suspicious. \\n\\nWhat if Ned\\'s love for Ashara and respect for Arthur caused him to lie for them? Edric has unknown parentage. Arthur and Ashara were never found. Perhaps they have been living in the neck with the Reeds and sent their son to be nursed by their old friend Wylla? \\n\\nNow to take this crazy theory even further. It\\'s widely accepted that Dany\\'s early years are mysterious. And the house with the red door and lemon tree is almost certainly not in Braavos. Starfall is known to have sweetened lemon wine. Perhaps Dany was passed off as Rhaella\\'s daughter after growing up in Starfall with her parents. This would also explain why Dany and her \"brother\" Viserys don\\'t share her heat resistance. Dany also is able to hatch dragon eggs while Jahaerys(?) isn\\'t able to hatch any during the rumored tragedy at Summerhall. This leads me to believe that the Targaryen bloodline that is widely accepted isn\\'t the true dragon connected Targaryen line that the original Aegon came from. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure exactly where the whole Blackfyre thing fits in, but it\\'s undoubtedly important due to the fact that GRRM felt the need to write a whole bunch of additional content centred around the Dance. I believe that the Daynes are the ones with the true Valerian blood. We\\'re given purple eyes as a way to identify Targaryens. We\\'re then shown the Daynes and told to just disregard their eye color. We\\'re shown the connection between Targaryen and dragon and then we\\'re shown that the Targaryens let the dragons die off. It doesn\\'t add up. Dany\\'s qualities are unique from those of her entire family and I don\\'t think it\\'s a fluke. I don\\'t know exactly how this fits in with fAegon or Jon Snow or Edric. But I do think that this is an integral piece of the story that has been hidden in plain sight.\\n\\nI hope I haven\\'t gone off the deep end into time traveling fetus territory. I also hope I\\'m not just parroting another theory that\\'s been laid out more thoroughly. Hopefully I\\'m somewhere in the middle and hopefully you guys have some opinions on things I\\'m missing or misinterpreting or things I\\'ve pointed out that you\\'ve missed.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '1. “My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you hear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.” - Prologue, p. 1\\n1. “It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman’s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?” - Catelyn, p. 24\\n1. “Let them see that you  have a woman’s shape now.” His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. - Daenerys, p. 26\\n1. The sack of King’s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper’s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar’s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes.  - Daenerys, p. 27\\n1. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. - Daenerys, p. 29\\n1. “And stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.” - Daenerys, p. 35\\n1. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. - Catelyn, p. 61\\n1. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast. - Bran, p. 80\\n1. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. - Daenerys, p. 96\\n1. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. - Daenerys, p. 103.\\n1. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. - Daenerys, p. 103\\n1. It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. - Daenerys, p. 103\\n1. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin’s soldiers had torn him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall. - Eddard, p. 107\\n1. “Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King’s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.” - Eddard, p. 191.\\n1. “You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord’s slut, do you hear me?” His hand went under her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. - Daenerys, p. 223.\\n1. “And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it’s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.” - Tyrion, p. 321\\n1. As Catelyn held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who’d waited beside her that day in the sept at Riverrun. - Catelyn, p. 363\\n1. She opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. - Catelyn, p. 365\\n1. “Is he a bad man?” the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother’s breast popping from his mouth, the nipple wet and red. - Catelyn, p. 365\\n1. She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that her bosom was freckled as well. - Eddard, p. 368.\\n1. “He had better,” Viserys said grimly. “I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it. The dragon is not mocked.” Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret’s head, he rode off to inspect it more closely. - Daenerys, p. 375\\n1. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small, tender breasts. - Daenerys, p. 382\\n1. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls. - Tyrion, p. 404\\n1. “He shall be called Rhaego,” she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught her. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. - Daenerys, p. 474.\\n1. He was looking on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. - Daenerys, p. 476.\\n1. The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within her. - Daenerys, p. 477.\\n1. “They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood here in the sacred city... but I can.” He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. - Daenerys, p. 481\\n1. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at her mother’s breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at his forge, and all the others. - Eddard, p. 489\\n1. The wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it came from the wrong side. - Arya, p. 511\\n1. She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. - Daenerys, p. 647\\n1. Bronn had done well enough; she was doe-eyed and slim, with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked. - Tyrion, p. 655\\n1. He could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay beside him. - Tyrion, p. 656.\\n1. As she watched him, this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels, all she could see was the babe they had laid at her breast at Riverrun, so long ago. - Catelyn, p. 671.\\n1. A thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between Dany’s swollen breasts. - Daenerys, p. 678.\\n1. “Princess, hear me. The Dothraki will not follow a suckling babe. Drogo’s strength was what they bowed to, and only that. When he is gone, Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos will fight for his place, and this khalasar will devour itself. The winner will want no more rivals. The boy will be taken from your breast the moment he is born. They will give him to the dogs...” - Daenerys, p. 683.\\n1. Dany remembered the story Viserys had told her, of what the Usurper’s dogs had done to Rhaegar’s children. His son had been a babe as well, yet they had ripped him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall. - Daenerys, p. 683.\\n1. “Kicks are too merciful for a maegi. Take her outside. We will stake her to the earth, to be the mount of every passing man. And when they are done with her, the dogs will use her as well. Weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes. The flies off the river shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts...” - Daenerys, p. 684\\n1. Her words were a knife through Dany’s breast. - Daenerys, p. 685\\n1. As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift. - Arya, p. 698\\n1. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin. - Daenerys, p. 727\\n1. The birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would have wanted, but Doreah had taught her other ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end she had bathed him with her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise. - Daenerys, p. 736.\\n1. Inside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. - Daenerys, p. 736.\\n1. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened. - Tyrion, p. 746\\n1. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. - Daenerys, p. 775,\\n1. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. - Daenerys, p. 779\\n1. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. - Daenerys, p. 779.\\n1. The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. - Daenerys, p. 780.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Another Dunk and Egg post, since I’ve been thinking about this series of events.\\n\\nGeorge’s next Dunk and Egg story has to do with the battle between the Starks and the Ironmen.  I don’t think he’s specified what might come after, but I think it’s safe to assume that the events leading up to Egg’s reign are probably it, since Egg is present at the Siege of Starpike, where Maekar is killed.  This is an important event where details are intentionally sparse.\\n\\nNotably, Egg is a knight by this time with a squire of his own.  He knights the heir to Casterly Rock, before the man dies.  \\n\\nThis got me thinking: what is Dunk going to do once Egg is no longer his squire, and before he’s inducted into the Kingsguard?  It’s hard to think they’d part, but I think it’s possible that they may be forced to for a time while Egg sees to some of his princely duties as a result of reaching manhood.  Dunk has never wanted favors or felt worthy of being accepted among nobility, so I think he may *insist* on their parting...until Maekar dies and Aemon or Egg sends for Dunk, needing the support and help of their friend during a dangerous time while the succession is worked out.\\n\\nI thought about where Dunk might go during this time...and it seems that this may be the perfect opportunity for him to visit Starfall on his own, maybe just to see the “sapphire isle” for himself.  The theory that he is Brienne’s ancestor is common at this point, and I think that if he *does* get the chance to....get down with some noblewoman, it would almost certainly be in secret and while he’s away from Egg.\\n\\nHas anyone thought about this?  I really just enjoy seeing everyone’s theories and fitting pieces together that someone else picked up on better than me.',\n",

While this is partly true, since Martin still has not released the last two books, the last one, ADwD, having come out at July 2011. It is also a mendacious lie, used to cover up David and Dan's failures, because, they didn't actually run out of book material, they simply ignored many plotlines and character arcs. The following is just some of the many plotlines from the books they discarded. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* Young Griff/Aegon, along with Jon Connington in ADwD\\n* Arianne scheming to make Myrcella queen in AFoC, or maybe the entire Dorne plot as it is in the books.\\n* Quentyn Martell's journey to Dany in ADwD\\n* Lady Stoneheart\\n* Victarion's journey to Dany in ADwD\\n* Jaime's diplomatic quest through Riverlands in AFoC and ADwD, and his journey to becoming an honourable man.\\n*  Brienne's quest to find Sansa in AFoC, as it is in the books\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '**This essay is also available as a video, [click here if you\\'d prefer to watch.](https://youtu.be/lGRumUAMTj0)**\\n\\n&gt;Androw Farman was located at last in the Chamber of the Painted Table, a longsword clutched in his grasp. He made no attempt to deny the poisonings. Instead he boasted. “I brought them cups of wine, and they drank. They thanked me, and they drank. Why not? A cupbearer, a serving man, that’s how they saw me. Androw the sweet. Androw the jape. What could I do, but fall off the dragon? Well, I could have done a lot of things. I could have been a lord. I could have made laws and been wise and given you counsel. I could have killed your enemies, as easily as I killed your friends. I could have given you children.”\\n\\nAndrow Farman committed a terrible crime and became a mass murderer in 54 AC on the Targaryen home of Dragonstone. During the reign of King Jaehaerys I and Queen Alysanne, Androw systematically poisoned four women and the Maester on the island, saving his wife Rhaena Targaryen for last. This kind of horror movie plot is not the kind of thing people associate with A Song of Ice and Fire. Most of the time the assassinations and mass deaths are the result of political or military goals being further. Androw, however, killed brutally out of vengeance and in a way that seemed only vindictive. The unasked question though in this tragedy is how did the simple Androw pull off his killing spree at all? Did he have help? And if so, why help Androw Farman murder six people?\\n \\nAndrow Farman was the husband, in name only, for Rhaena Targaryen, older sister to the King Jaehaerys I and Queen Alysanne Targaryen known as the “Queen in the West”. Rhaena had known Androw and House Farman of Fair Isle for many years when Androw’s father sheltered Rhaena from the wrath of her uncle, Maegor the Cruel. Shortly after her baby brother Jaehaerys’ coronation in Oldtown, Rhaena flew north and with little explanation married Androw in a secret ceremony. When asked why she did this, Rhaena replied that Androw was kind to her and left it at that.\\n\\nThe complication of their relationship was that Rhaena had little interest in Androw. It’s suggested in the text that they never consummated their marriage. Rhaena actually was in love with Androw’s sister, Elissa Farman. Rhaena married Androw while carrying on in an open secret with Elissa among other lovers. Androw became angered over the years as he was treated by Rhaena and her court of friends and lovers as little more than a servant or jester,  he had no say in any decision, was openly embarrassed and laughed at. These grudges from Androw festered  and he went from angry to murderous coming to a head in 54 AC after his sister Elissa disappeared into the East with three dragons eggs.\\n\\nAndrow’s actions required a lot of planning, knowledge, and subterfuge to pull off correctly. For instance, among the first to die by poison was the elderly Maester Culipper. This is a highly intelligent move as it stops the most knowledgeable person on the island from figuring the \"sickness\" was poison. This level of intelligence and planning from Androw seems at odds with his slow, dull mind that is explicitly mentioned in Fire and Blood.\\n\\n&gt;Though he had been born upon an island and now lived upon another, Androw did not sail or swim or fish. A failed squire, he had no skill with sword nor axe nor spear, so when the men of the castle garrison trained each morning in the yard, he kept to his bed. Thinking that he might be of a bookish disposition, Maester Culiper tried to interest him in the treasures of Dragonstone’s library, the ponderous tomes and Old Valyrian scrolls that had fascinated King Jaehaerys, only to discover\\nthat the queen’s husband could not read. Androw rode passably well, and from time to time would have a horse saddled so he might trot about the yard, but he never passed beyond the gates to explore the Dragonmont’s rocky paths or the far side of the island, nor even the fishing village and docks beneath the castle.\\n\\n&gt;The knights and men-at-arms pay him no mind whatsoever, and the servants obey him or not, as they please, with no fear of his displeasure. The children are the cruelest, as children often are, and none half so cruel as the Princess Aerea. She once emptied a chamberpot upon his head, not for anything he did, but because she was wroth with her mother.\\n\\nHis characterization casts major doubt on how he pulled off these murders. It’d be like hearing Victarion Grejoy won a game of Cyvasse or Pate the Citadel Novice became Archmaester. You would be extremely suspicious, and much the same here. He must have had some help in planning his killing spree. It was expertly planned out from the strategy of who to poison, how to deliver the poison, and even which poison to use to not arouse suspicion. The murders seem very similar to Lysa Arryn poisoning her husband Jon Arryn. Lysa used the Tears of Lys as well and acted at the urging of Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger used Lysa’s feelings for him to turn her into an assassin.\\n\\nTears, tears, tears,\" she sobbed hysterically. \"No need for tears . . . but that\\'s not what you said in King\\'s Landing. You told me to put the tears in Jon\\'s wine, and I did. For Robert, and for us! And I wrote Catelyn and told her the Lannisters had killed my lord husband, just as you said. That was so clever . . . you were always clever, I told Father that, I said Petyr\\'s so clever, he\\'ll rise high, he will, he will, and he\\'s sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly . . . Why did you kiss her? Why? We\\'re together now, we\\'re together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss herrrrrr?\"\\n\\n\\nIn addition, the choice of his poison and delivery methods were highly effective as well. Rather than using a poison like the Strangler, famously used on King Joffrey Baratheon which kills almost instantly by choking, Androw used a more slow acting and harder to detect poison called the Tears of Lys.\\n\\nThe Tears of Lys resembles a disease of the bowels and can easily seem like an outbreak rather than a murder. King Jaehaerys believed the same when he was alerted by the Maester and he ordered Dragonstone quarantined by warships until the “disease” ran its course rather than allowing its spread.It’s also important that Androw used the Tears of Lys. The tears are a very rare and expensive poison made by the Alchemists of Lys normally reserved for professional murders. The poison is odorless, colorless, and has no taste. Only some maesters can even recognize it the effects of the poison as it is made in Essos primarily and few Maesters carry any examples.\\n\\nMaester Pycelle famously recognizes that the Tears were used on Jon Arryn because of his mastery on poisons and lets the hand of the King die rather than helping him.\\n\\n&gt;Tyrion tsked at him. \"I saw the tears of Lys among your potions. And you sent away Lord Arryn\\'s own maester and tended him yourself, so you could make certain that he died.\"\\n\\n&gt;Yes,\" he whimpered, \"yes, Colemon was purging, so I sent him away. The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, she did not say so, could not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at her I knew. It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear it.\" The old man wept.\\n\\nMaester Culiper on Dragonstone though did not recognize the poison in time. Before he succumbed to the poison, he had been trying to figure out which disease was afflicting the island.\\n\\n&gt;It was not the sweating sickness, nor the shaking sickness, nor greyscale, Maester Culiper pronounced. The first sign was a bloody stool, followed by a terrible cramping in the gut. There were a number of diseases that could be the cause, he told the queen. Which of those might be to blame he never determined, for Culiper himself was the first to die, less than two days after\\nhe began to feel ill.\\n\\nThis tells us that Culiper did not have any of the Tears of Lys on the island nor intimate knowledge of it like Pycelle did. Had he known the substance well he or his junior Maester Anselm would’ve recognized the symptoms and that it was missing from the stores. Rather it curiously fell to Jaehaerys\\' Master of Coin, Rego Draz, to identify the Tears of Lys instead of sickness as the cause.\\n\\n&gt;“We know more of such things in the Free Cities,” Draz assured him. “It is the tears, never doubt it. The old maester would have seen it soon enough, so he had to die first. That is how I would do it. Not that I would. Poison is…Dishonorable.”\\n\\nWe’ll get back to later Rego outlining the exact strategy Androw used, but for now it’s enough to say that Androw was given Tears of Lys. Androw is not personally wealthy enough to outright buy the poison, and it’s unlikely that Rhaena would lend him the huge amount of coin when she barely lets him make decisions. Unlike someone like Littlefinger or Varys who could acquire rare poisons via their vast information networks and contacts, Androw had no networks and few contacts. Without the ability to compose or send his own letters, he also couldn’t write for help. Someone knew of his grievances with Rhaena personally, had a way to reach him on Dragonstone, gave him a well thought out plan for revenge, and the poison to carry it out. Someone intelligent, wealthy, and with a bone to pick with Rhaena Targaryen.\\n\\nAlthough Rhaena survived the encounter, it is clear that the attack was meant to hurt her emotionally before being the last victim.\\n\\n&gt;“You weep for her,” Androw Farman said when he saw the tears on his wife’s face, “but would you weep for me?” His words woke a fury in the queen. Lashing him across the face, Rhaena commanded him to leave her, declaring that she wanted to be alone. “You shall be,” Androw said. “She was the last of them.”\\n\\nHad  Rego not noticed the symptoms of the Tears of Lys and the message sent to Rhaena right away, it’s likely that Androw would’ve finished his killing spree. With that in mind let’s put on our Ned Stark detective hats and see if we can puzzle out who enabled Androw Farman and his revenge.\\n\\nThe classic investigative technique for criminal acts is something we’ve all heard many times: Means, motive, opportunity. Let’s start with motive. Over her lifetime, Queen Rhaena had made many enemies. What often caused that was her loner streak and rudeness.\\n\\n&gt;As a little girl, she often hid behind her mother’s skirt or clung to her father’s leg in the presence of strangers…but she loved to feed the castle cats, and always had a puppy or two in the bed. Though her mother provided her with a succession of suitable companions, the daughters of lords great and small, Rhaena never seemed to warm to any of them, preferring the company of a book.\\n\\nHer behavior softened slightly as she became an adult, yet she never really developed the graceful politicking and the gift of quick friendships that her younger sister Alysanne excelled at. While Alysanne charmed those around her into doing what she wanted, Rhaena preferred using the threat of her dragon Dreamfyre or her sharp tongue to get her way.\\n\\nRhaena also had a bad habit of holding grudges. When she was young and married to her elder brother and heir to the Iron Throne Aegon, all seemed right in their world. However the Faith of the Seven had enough of the Targaryen incest and felt that King Aenys I lacked the strength to oppose them. The Faith Militant revolted and Aegon and Rhaena while they were on a royal progress. They were forced to hide in Crakehall Castle until the revolt died down. Rhaena never forgot which lords had turned on them.\\n\\nAfter her uncle Maegor seized the Iron Throne,  Rhaena and Aegon attempted to push their claim in the field. The royal couple found little support outside the Westerlands although several great lords pledged their support if Aegon could win a battle first. This forced Aegon the Uncrowned into a foolhardy charge to King’s Landing. It ended brutally at Harrenhal when Maegor appeared on Balerion the Black Dread and killed Aegon and his dragon Quicksilver. Rhaena never forgave those Lords.\\n\\nRhaena held a particular grudge about her younger siblings. At this point in Westeros, it had not been established what the rules of succession really were and some believed that daughters could be ruling monarchs over their male siblings. Rhaena was the oldest living child of King Aenys over her younger brother Jaehaerys. And yet, when Maegor fell it was Jaehaerys that was crowned King over her.\\n\\n&gt;Also, with the passage of time Queen Rhaena grew ever more resentful that her own claim to the Iron Throne, and that of her daughters, had been disregarded in favor of that of “my baby brother” (as she was wont to call Jaehaerys). She was the firstborn, she reminded those who would listen, and had been a dragonrider before any of her siblings, yet all of them and “even my own mother” had conspired to pass her over.\\n\\n**Lyman Lannister**\\n\\n-------\\n\\nIn research for this, I noted too many suspects so we’ll talk about the best candidates for who helped Androw. The first suspects are the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. They sheltered Rhaena when she had nowhere to go, protected her while she gave birth, they gave her lavish gifts and treatment, They also expected that they would be rewarded with a marriage or dragon egg for their trouble.\\n\\n&gt;“They were kings once,” she reminded Sam Stokeworth. “He smiles, but he was raised on tales of the Field of Fire; he will not have forgotten.” Rhaena Targaryen knew her history as well; the history of the Freehold of Valyria, writ in blood and fire.\\n\\nThe Lannisters had gambled big on Rhaena, and it did not pay off. When Jaehaerys was looking for counselors in key positions, the Lords of the Westerlands were left out conspicuously despite their power, armies, and piles of gold.\\n\\n&gt;Several of his advisors urged King Jaehaerys to appoint Lyman Lannister, supposedly the richest lord in Westeros, but Jaehaerys was disinclined. “Unless Lord Lyman can find a mountain of gold under the Red Keep, I do not know that he has the answer we require,”\\n\\nIt could’ve been just practicality that made Jaehaerys overlook the Westerlands for years, but given how much of a problem Rhaena was for Jaehaerys it seems closer to aggressive ignoring. Especially considering the Lannisters were one of the first great houses to rally to Jaehaerys’ cause and you’d expect the new young king would reward them. Instead they got nothing. Ridding King Jaehaerys of his troublesome older sister and paying their debt back to her would be a well calculated move to gain favor.\\n\\nWhile they have motive, the Lannisters lack in opportunity. They are certainly wealthy enough to afford the Tears of Lys, but they lack the ability to contact Androw. Casterly Rock is on the other side of Westeros from Dragonstone, and during this time they had little to no presence in King’s Landing or Dragonstone. Letters were out because anything sent to Androw would have to be read to him which would give away the plot. As far as I can tell, there was no one on Dragonstone even from the Westerlands except the Farmans. The only connection they had was Androw’s older brother, Lord Franklyn Farman of Fair Isle in the Westerlands. Franklyn hated Rhaena with a passion after how she left Fair Isle.\\n\\n&gt;Oblivious to their mood, his lordship attempted to seize his sister…whereupon the onlookers rushed forward, overwhelming his men before they could draw their blades. Three of them were shoved off the docks into the water, whilst Lord Franklyn himself was thrown into a ship’s hold full of fresh-caught cod. Elissa Farman and the rest of the queen’s friends boarded Maiden’s Fancy untouched and set sail for Lannisport.\\n\\nThere’s a slim possibility that Franklyn arrived on Dragonstone with the Tears and convinced his younger brother Androw to go on a killing spree, but it’s very tenuous. How would they know in advance that Androw would be receptive? It’s a long dangerous trip across Westeros by land or sea especially when Androw couldn’t correspond by letter without alerting the Maesters. While the motive exists for the Lannisters and Farmans to take revenge on Rhaena, the opportunity is very lacking.\\n\\n**Rogar Baratheon**\\n\\n----------\\n\\nSecond suspect, we have Lord Rogar Baratheon. As I mentioned before, Rhaena held grudges against those who had withheld their aid from her first husband Aegon. She never forgot that her husband died because Lords like Rogar made their support contingent on a first victory. However Rogar forgot that stipulation and was more than happy to support another untested Targaryen; Rhaena’s 14 year old “baby brother” Jaehaerys. Rogar also lead the campaign about why Rhaena couldn’t rule.\\n\\n&gt;Her sex told against her, however. “This is not Dorne,” Lord Rogar Baratheon said when\\nthe notion was put to him, “and Rhaena is not Nymeria.”\\n\\nAfter Jaehaerys was crowned king in Oldtown with Rhaena in attendance, she took flight on Dreamfyre to Fair Isle and got married in a secret ceremony to Androw Farman which enraged the soon to be named Hand of the King Rogar Baratheon.\\n\\nIt’s clear that in the ascension of Jaehaerys, Rogar felt that his support (much like Lyman Lannister) deserved a reward like a royal marriage. At this time Rhaena was twice a widow between Aegon and Maegor, but still only 25 years old, beautiful, and a dragon rider. Rogar was a widower, and eventually married Rhaena’s mother Dowager Queen Alyssa. In the text it is implied that Rogar was furious because he wanted his younger brothers to marry Rhaena to secure the Targaryen-Baratheon alliance. However it is certainly possible that Rogar wanted the Queen in the West for himself.  Rhaena had declared loudly with her marriage that she would not live her life asking for Jaehaerys’ nor Rogar Baratheon’s permission. She also refused to attend the wedding between Rogar and her mother Alyssa.\\n\\nThe major breaking point though came shortly before Androw Farman’s murders on Dragonstone. The Dowager Queen Alyssa was pregnant with her second child by Lord Rogar, but it became clear that Alyss would not survive the childbirth. The Maester feared that she would take the infant with her to the grave as well. Rogar sent the news to Jaehaerys and Alysanne, but not to Rhaena. It’s noted that Androw offered to accompany Rhaena once she heard of her mother’s health, but she refused him in a loud argument and was quoted as yelling,\\n\\n“The wrong Farman ran away.”\\n\\nBack to Storm’s End though, King Jaehaerys had a terrible choice. The maester told him that Alyssa would die, but there was hope for the baby if they cut it out of her. The operation would kill Alyssa. Jaehaerys found himself unable to choose, and put it to the drunk Rogar to decide Alyssa\\'s fate.\\n\\n&gt;The king said only, “The woman is my mother, and a queen,” in a heavy tone. He stepped outside\\nagain, pulled Rogar Baratheon to his feet, and dragged him back into the birthing chamber, where he bade the maester repeat what he had just said.\\n\\n&gt;“She is your wife,” King Jaehaerys reminded Lord Rogar. “It is for you to say the words.”\\n\\n&gt;Lord Rogar, we are told, could not bear to look upon his wife. Nor could he find the words until the king took him roughly by the arm and shook him.\\n\\n&gt;“Save my son,” Rogar told the maester. Then he wrenched free and fled the room again. Maester Kyrie bowed his head and sent for his blades.\\n\\nThe child was saved but Alyssa died. Rhaena arrived in a rage that started with Androw and only heightened when she learned that Alyssa was dead and that Rogar was the cause of it after seeing the wounds the maester’s knives left. Her tirade was pure Fire and Blood.\\n\\n&gt;“Where is Rogar?” she asked.\\nShe found him below in his great hall with his young son, Boremund, in his lap, surrounded by his brothers and his knights. Rhaena Targaryen pushed through all of them to stand over him, and began to curse him to his face.\\n“Her blood is on your hands,” she raged at him. “Her blood is on your cock. May you die screaming.”\\n\\n&gt;Rogar Baratheon was outraged by her accusations. “What are you saying, woman? This is the will of the gods. The Stranger comes for all of us. How could it be my doing? What did I do?”\\n\\n&gt;“You put your cock in her. She gave you one son, that should have been enough. Save my wife, you should have said, but what are wives to men like you?”\\n\\n&gt;Rhaena reached out and grabbed his beard and pulled his face to hers.\\n“Hear this, my lord. Do not think to wed again. Take care of the whelps my mother gave you, my half-brother and half-sister. See that they want for nothing. Do that, and I will let you be. If I should hear even a whisper of your taking some other poor maid to wife, I will make another Harrenhal of Storm’s End, with you and her inside it.”\\n\\nNo one would react kindly to a Targaryen threatening to burn down their home around them and roast them inside. And certainly not the hot blooded Rogar who was a typical Baratheon warrior by heart. Rogar once ordering his men to separate the newlywed Jaehaerys and Alyssane at swordpoint because he disapproved of their marriage and according to rumors sending women to Dragonstone to seduce Jaehaerys into abandoning their marriage with sexual temptations. He hated being defeated, especially by those he deemed lesser than himself.\\n\\n&gt;A proud man, he had been stunned and angered by the “ingratitude” of the boy king he had regarded as a son, and humiliated when forced to back down at the gates of Dragonstone before half a hundred of his men. A warrior to the bone, Rogar had once dreamed of facing Maegor the Cruel in single combat, and could not stomach being shamed by a lad of fifteen years.\\n\\nRogar had been shamed in his own halls by Rhaena, berated and blamed for the death of his wife by a woman he loathed. He would want his revenge, to punish Rhaena for the insults and threats his entire castle and soon the realm would hear. That is certainly motive enough after years of tension between the two.\\n\\nRogar had the means to pull this off. Prior to this incident, Lord Rogar served as Hand of the King,  married to the royal family, and he was Lord of the Stormlands and all its incomes. He could definitely afford to buy Tears of Lys. And his time as Hand of the King would assuredly put him in contact with the kinds of people that could get the poison discreetly and deliver it.\\n\\nRogar even has a past of attempting sabotage on Dragonstone. As I mentioned, the rumors in Fire and Blood say that the Baratheons sent a woman named Coryanne Wylde to seduce and bed the newlywed King Jaehaerys. While that attempt failed reportedly, Coryanne ended up fleeing the island with a young knight named Ser Howard Bullock to Pentos. Ser Howard’s father, Ser Merrell Bullock, remained the Commander of the Garrison at Dragonstone and certainly knew Androw Farman. Ser Merrell was coincidentally dismissed from his position in the wake of Elissa Farman’s dragon egg theft shortly before the murders. Rhaena blamed Androw for helping his sister, but when that got her nowhere she turned on Ser Merrell who she deemed too incompetent to stop the theft or was in on it and fired him.\\n\\nThrough the Bullocks and Coryanne Wild, it’s possible Lord Rogar made connections on Dragonstone. After Rhaena humiliated both Ser Merrell and Lord Rogar in quick succession, Rogar may have found a way of connecting with Bullock and exploited his anger at Rhaena. Ser Merrell’s other son, Ser Alyn, still served on Dragonstone after his father was dismissed. There may even be a hint that Androw was friendly with the Bullocks.\\n\\nAfter Ser Merrell’s dismissal, Androw curiously requested of his wife that he be named Garrison commander which did not go over well.\\n\\n&gt;When the queen dismissed Ser Merrell Bullock, Androw had asked her to appoint him commander of the castle garrison in Bullock’s place. Her Grace had been breaking her fast with four of her ladies-in-waiting at the time. The women burst into laughter at his request, and after a moment the queen had laughed as well.\\n\\nAndrow suddenly volunteered to be the commander of the garrison with no background or skills. He may have gotten to know the Bullocks during their time on Dragonstone a little and maybe felt after hearing their stories he could do the job. Maester Culiper recorded that Farman had few friends outside of his sister Elissa, but perhaps he missed these.\\n\\nIt’s also intriguing that Androw requests to go with Rhaena twice following the theft of the eggs. The first is to King’s Landing to tell Jaehaerys about the stolen eggs, which Rhaena rejects. And second, to Storm’s End for Alyssa. But it was the Storm’s End journey that Androw uncharacteristically got into his screaming argument with Rhaena. Knowing how shortly after Androw begins his murder spree, we have to take these requests in a different light. He wanted to go to King’s Landing, but desperately wanted to go to Storm’s End. Perhaps at this time Rogar was already in contact with Androw and Androw wanted a meeting.\\n\\nThe point of contact between Rogar and Androw is a bit flimsy, however in all other aspects the Lord of Storm’s End seems like a perfect candidate. He has in the past proved himself a willing user of subterfuge. Not only Coryanne Wylde, but he previously had his men attempt to kidnap both of Rhaena’s daughters to use them to overthrow JaehAerys. He has very good reasons for wanting Rhaena dead and revenge on her following her threats after Alyssa’s death. Rogar seems a very likely suspect for aiding Androw Farman.\\n\\n**Jaehaerys I**\\n\\n----------------------\\n\\nOur last suspect is a very sly one, one that George hid in details and unsaid tensions. And that is Rhaena’s younger brother Jaehaerys or members of his small council. Wait, I hear you thinking, Jaehaerys the Conciliator? A kin slayer? A murderer? How could HE be behind a monster like Androw Farman? Well, let’s first off turn back to that curious quote by Jaehaerys’ master of Coin Rego Draz.\\n\\n&gt;“We know more of such things in the Free Cities,” Draz assured him. “It is the tears, never doubt it. The old maester would have seen it soon enough, so he had to die first. That is how I would do it. Not that I would. Poison is… Dishonorable.”\\n\\nRego Draz is a very smart person, however he says out loud the exact strategy used on Dragonstone by Androw Farman. Kill the older maester first because he will figure out you’re using the Tears of Lys, and then you can kill the other target easily. No one else caught on to Farman’s murders until Rego. In addition, we learn in Fire and Blood that Regor Draz is the pseudo spymaster of King Jaehaerys. When Rhaena’s daughter Aerea flies away on Balerion, it is Rego\\'s spy network the crown uses to try and find her.\\n\\n&gt;Benifer, acting through the Pentoshi master of coin, who had agents in every port, reached out across the narrow sea as the king had commanded…“paying good coin to bad men” (in the words of Rego Draz) for any news of dragon eggs, dragons,\\nor Elissa Farman. A small host of whisperers, informers, courtiers, and courtesans produced hundreds of reports, a score of which proved to be of value to the Iron Throne for other reasons…but every rumor of the dragon eggs proved worthless.\\n\\nAlso Rego is well aware of the poison itself, has connections back into Essos that could procure it for him, and many underworld connections. And what works for Rogar with Ser Bullock works even better for Jaehaerys. Jaehaerys spent large amounts of time on the island with Alysanne and knew the garrison extremely well. They even defended the young monarchs against Lord Rogar’s previously mentioned incursion. A dismissed Dragonstone commander is exactly the kind of person that would be looking for new friends and employers, which the Master of Coin and King can provide. If you want to work out a strategic murder on Dragonstone, Rego Draz is the man you ask.\\n\\nAnd there’s a second possibility. A lesser known member of Jaehaerys’ small council, Master of Laws Albin Massey. While Lord Albin is rarely thought of, he’s intriguing as a someone who could’ve assisted Androw. Before his appointment, Massey had been training as a maester of the Citadel for three years until his father and older brothers died. And maester’s training typically involves some knowledge of poison. Some more than others depending on their concentration of study.\\n\\nThere’s two curious quotes about Lord Massey. First, is his response to a crisis of the Faith of the Seven. Jaehaerys’ chosen High Septon, who enshrined in the Faith that Jaehaerys was allowed to marry his sister, had died. The troublesome Septon Mattheus seemed poised to become the new High Septon, undo his predecessor\\'s decrees, and restart the Faith Militant. While Rego Draz suggests buying off the voters in the Faith, Massey offers a bloodier suggestion.\\n\\n&gt;Albin Massey, the bent-backed master of laws, wondered if Septon Mattheus might suffer the same fate as the High Septon who had made such trouble for Aenys and Maegor; a sudden, mysterious death.\\n\\nJaehaerys reportedly rejected the suggestion however it is interesting that it is Massey who put it forwards. I’m sure the young King didn’t forget that about Lord Massey. Following the murders on Dragonstone, Hand of the King Daemon Velaryon quits his position and Jaehaerys considers Massey of all his counselors as his new Hand. However, Massey turns him down.\\n\\n&gt;Lord Albin, with his limp and twisted back, would strike the ignorant as somehow sinister. “They look at me and see a villain,” Massey himself told the king. “I can serve you better from the shadows.”\\n\\nA man who works in the shadows and suggests assassinations would certainly fit the bill of who you would task with eliminating Rhaena. And that gets to the heart of the issue, why would Jaehaerys want Rhaena dead?\\n\\nUnlike with Lord Rogar, the problems between the siblings are much more hard to spot because of the way Fire and Blood is written. The author of the book, the fictional Maester Gyldayn, stanned Jaehaerys and paints him in the best light. There’s very little of the animosity between the siblings explicitly, but their actions and few recorded conversations tell a different tale.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of Jaehaerys I reign at 14 he had a massive shadow over him in the shape of Rhaena and Dreamfyre. There was no Great Councils setting aside female claimants at this time. Those would be enacted by Jaehaerys himself near the end of his life. It wasn’t clear that Jaehaerys had the better claim outside of Lord Rogar Baratheon’s armies, and there were those who thought Rhaena should’ve been crowned instead. Her presence in the realm and her claim was a threat to his new reign. Every lord who grew annoyed with Jaehaerys had the convenient option of courting Rhaena or her daughters and using them as weapons against the Iron Throne.\\n\\nThese tensions only grew worse when Rhaena married without permission Androw Farman.This act showed up Jaehaerys’ authority which he desperately needed as a newly crowned teenage king. Her marriage also deprived him of an important tool in solidifying his rule by taking a marriage to Rhaena off the political table. When people began calling her the Queen in the West, she refused to show up for their mother’s wedding, and she took up with the Lannisters, it’s not hard to see how Jaehaerys may have been nervous about her intentions.\\n\\nIt\\'s never addressed in the book but Jaehaerys marrying Rhaena himself was a very good option for joining their competing claims. That it never comes up may signal that Rhaena’s marriage to Androw wasn’t only to spurn the Baratheons, but possibly her own newly crowned brother. If the siblings were married, the threat of another Targaryen civil war would be erased and there’d be no rogue Queens flying around Westeros. By marrying Androw, Rhaena ensured that civil war remained an option.\\n\\nRhaena also didn\\'t submit to the new king like the rest of the realm. She continued to act as a Queen outside of Jaehaerys’ authority to rule. When Rhaena finally wore out her welcome in the Westerlands and Riverlands, and she returned to King’s Landing for the marriage of Jaehaerys and Alysanne. But Rhaena returned not looking to congratulate the Royal couple, but to bargain with her baby brother.\\n\\n&gt;it is Dreamfyre who excites them. Some fear her, more want her, and it is those who trouble me most. They lust for dragons of their own. That I will not give them, but where am I to go?”\\n\\n&gt;“Here,” the king suggested. “Return to court.”\\n\\n&gt;“And live forever in your shadow? I need a seat of my own. A place where no lord may threaten me, banish me, or trouble those I have taken under my protection. I need lands, men, a castle.”\\n\\n&gt;“We can find you lands,” the king said, “build you a castle.”\\n\\n&gt;“All the lands are taken, all the castles occupied,” Rhaena replied, “but there is one I have a claim to…a better claim than your own, brother. I am the blood of the dragon. I want my father’s seat, the place where I was born. I want Dragonstone.”\\n\\nJaehaerys did not immediately agree to Rhaena’s demands. It seems like a non-issue, Dragonstone is a worthless rock with no income or food that Stannis bemoans. In Rhaena’s time though, Dragonstone had one enormous resource that existed nowhere else: dragons. Almost all the Targaryen dragons including Balerion and the caches of eggs were on Dragonstone. The king would’ve handed Rhaena the greatest source of Targaryen dominance and the tools to overthrow him. He drove a hard bargain in response.\\n\\n&gt;But you shall hold the island and the castle by my gift, not by right. Our grandsire made seven kingdoms into one with\\nfire and blood, I cannot and will not make them two by carving you off a separate kingdom of your own. You are a queen by courtesy, but I am king, and my writ runs from Oldtown to the Wall…and on Dragonstone as well. Are we of one mind on this, sister?”\\n&gt;\\n“Are you so uncertain of that iron seat that you must needs have your own blood bend the knee to you, brother?” Rhaena threw back at him. “So be it. Give me Dragonstone and one thing more, and I shall trouble you no further.”\\n\\nThey reached an uneasy peace that Rhaena agreed to recognize Jaehaerys finally as her King in exchange for Dragonstone and its dragons as well as her daughter Aerea. Aerea had grown up heir to the Iron Throne but was now second in line. Jaehaerys took a massive risk, giving Rhaena all she would need to declare herself queen with an heir and overthrow the Iron Throne. A risk Jaehaerys ended up regretting.\\n\\nWhen Elissa Farman stole the dragon eggs from Rhaena and fled across the Narrow Sea, Rhaena was livid at the betrayal. Jaehaerys though was on a whole other level of anger and concern at the theft. When she arrived in King’s Landing, the king was furious with Rhaena and personally blamed her for loss.\\n\\n&gt;“What do you mean to do?” his sister Rhaena asked him.\\n\\n&gt;“What I must. What you must. Do not think to wash your hands of this, sweet sister. You wanted Dragonstone and I gave it to you, and you brought this woman there. This thief.”\\n\\nNot just because it makes them look foolish, but if any of the Valyrian colonies got their dragons back the Targaryen foothold on Westeros would be over.\\n\\n&gt;Grand Maester Benifer said, “You are speaking of waging war across the\\nnarrow sea, Your Grace. The costs—”\\n\\n&gt;“—must needs be borne. I will not allow Valyria to rise again. Imagine what the triarchs of Volantis would do with dragons. Let us pray it never comes to that.” With that His Grace ended the audience, cautioning the others\\n\\nRhaena had not only broken the deal that they made by allowing their most valuable resources to be stolen by her estranged lover, but possibly set their future on fire by committing them to an intercontinental war against whoever bought the eggs from Elissa Farman. Rhaena had failed their family and the Iron Throne in a truly monumental way. She had gone from a possible problem to a massive liability to the Throne.\\n\\nRhaena’s behavior at Storm’s End may have been the last straw. While we cheer Rhaena for grabbing the pompous Rogar by his beard and screaming righteous fury at him, Jaehaerys has to deal with the fallout. Rogar already several times plotted to take Jaehaerys off the throne, and was a tenuous ally by blood at best. Rhaena took their tenuous relationship and lit it ablaze with the King still in the castle and their mother’s body cold.\\n\\nOn top of that, her daughter Aerea was furious that she had to live on Dragonstone with her mother. Rhaena had given her up years before for her safety, and so they barely knew each other. Also going from King’s Landing to Dragonstone is a huge bummer for a kid. The two often fought, with Aerea wishing to return home to King’s Landing and Rhaena denying her. Aerea also was adventurous, brave, strong willed, and not afraid of anything which is exactly the type of person you don’t want growing up angry when she has a recognized claim.\\n\\nAt this time, Jaehaerys had more reasons than most to want his sister out of the picture. Her very existence threatened his rule. She had taken the source of their power in the dragons then lost that power to the Free Cities over a lover’s squabble. She threatened to murder one of the Great Lords in their own castle. Was turning the defiant heir angry and bitter through poor parenting. Rhaena sewed chaos everywhere she went for a King who needed peace and stability.\\n\\nPerhaps the Queen in the East was a liability Jaehaerys could afford anymore. Maybe he inquired to his Masters of Coin and Laws how they would go about removing her from the board much in the same way they pondered how to deal with Septon Mattheus. Much like Rogar, never actually ordering Alyssa\\'s death. Remove Rhaena before she toppled his reign and in Androw Farman his council found a willing, angry participant. That would be Jaehaerys’ way, he preferred soft power and subtlety compared to his predecessor Maegor the Cruel.\\n\\nOne final curiosity to the Farman murders is the new hand of the King, Daemon Velaryon, abruptly quitting his post. It’s implied that he was upset that his niece, Lianna, was trapped on the island by the quarantine and eventually killed by Androw. But what if instead the Hand knew about or found out his King had helped Androw Farman. Quit in protest like Ned Stark did after King Robert ordered the poisoning Daenerys Targaryen. Or ashamed that the poison meant for Rhaena instead killed his niece.\\n\\nJaehaerys has all the factors you’d look for in a murder. His motivations are large and escalating quickly. Rhaena had proven herself a major source of frustration and problems for the crown, which were only getting worse. Jaehaerys also had the means in acquiring the poison and through Rego Draz and Lord Massey the contacts to deliver the Tears of Lys and instructions on how to use it effectively. Jaehaerys’ own personal relationships with people on the island and the recently dismissed Ser Bullock gave him the opportunity to take advantage of Androw’s simmering resentments.\\n\\n--------\\n\\nWhen Androw Farman began tipping Tears of Lys into the goblets of Casella Staunton, Septa Maryam, Alayne Royce, Lianna Velaron, Samantha Stokeworth, and Maester Culiper, who really was behind that poison? Who armed Androw Farman with the expensive assassin’s poison as well as the plan on how to use it? Who wanted Rhaena Targaryen to drink deep and die screaming? Was it the spurned Lions of Casterly Rock come to pay their debts? The vengeful Storm Lord Rogar Baratheon who never forgets an insult and thirsts for Targaryen blood? Or Rhaena’s own blood Jaehaerys, tired of Rhaena playing at queen and risking their lives and futures? Or somebody else I didn’t cover?\\n\\nhttps://forms.gle/itLFUhWqmMQeBhYY8\\n\\n**TL:DR** Androw Farman did not act alone in his Dragonstone murders. Best three candidates I could find are Lyman Lannister, Rogar Baratheon, and King Jaehaerys based on their motives, means, and opportunities to help Androw.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'In this post, I want to flesh out what I see as potential parallels between Dany and Mary Tudor, known to history as Bloody Mary.\\n\\nWe certainly seem headed to a second Dance of the Dragons-type succession crises in the coming books. The Dance of the Dragons was inspired by the Anarchy civil war that gripped England during the Middle Ages between Empress Matilda, her father Henry I\\'s only trueborn child, and her cousin Stephen of Blois -- with Stephen (aka Aegon II) defeated Matilda (aka Rhaenyra) but agreed to name her son, Henry FitzEmpress (aka Aegon Dragonsbane) as his heir to secure a peace. \\n\\nA different succession crisis might inspire some of the action yet to come: the succession crisis that followed the death of Henry VIII. \\n\\n# Bloody Mary\\n\\nA brief reminder: Mary\\'s father, Henry VIII, divorced her mother, Katherine of Aragon, because he wanted more heirs and Katherine had had a string of miscarriages. After the divorce, Mary spent most of her childhood essentially in a kind of domestic exile, nursing bitter resentments about being sent away from court. The divorce caused Henry to declare the UK a Protestant nation, with himself as the head of the new Anglican church, but Mary stayed true to her Catholic roots and never accepted the validity of her parents\\' divorce.\\n\\nHenry\\'s only trueborn son, Edward, was always sickly and died young, before he could marry or sire children. The throne would normally have gone to his older half-sisters, first Mary and then Elizabeth (daughter of Henry\\'s second wife, Anne Boleyn). However, worried that Mary would bring back Catholicism, the Protestant Edward attempted to disinherit *both* his half-sisters in favor of Lady Jane Grey, a great-granddaughter of Henry VII through the female line. But poor Jane was queen only for nine days before Mary seized the throne and had Jane and her scheming husband beheaded. \\n\\nWhen she took power, she married a powerful, unpopular Spaniard -- Spain was wealthy, and a major naval power of the day, and, like her, Catholic. It surely seemed like a good idea to Mary at the time, but her courtiers and commonfolk feared her husband would be king in all but name. And just as Edward had dreaded, she did try to take England back to Catholicism. When Protestants resisted this move, she burned hundreds at the stake. This only made her more unpopular and earned her the name Bloody Mary. \\n\\nShe did her best to be a good queen, but she was never able to win over the commons and never produced an heir. She did have one major false pregnancy (a bit of a mystery to this day -- perhaps uterine cancer) and probably at least one miscarriage. Her reign was also plagued by famine, which wasn\\'t her fault -- unusually wet weather that led to flooding and destroyed the crops in their fields -- but clearly undercut her rule. The treasury she inherited didn\\'t have much in the way of money to address this or the other problems faced by the realm.\\n\\nUltimately, an influenza epidemic killed her, and she was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth -- someone Mary had considered a bastard all her life. In fact, during Mary\\'s reign, she\\'d imprisoned her half-sister, worried about the plots that could be hatched around Elizabeth. \\n\\n# Fiery Dany\\n\\nI think we may see Dany follow the same path. We\\'ve already seen her lonely, bitter childhood in exile, and her adolescence spent brooding over the throne that should rightfully be hers. Going forward, she could marry someone (Euron?) she thinks will strengthen her claim to the Iron Throne, perhaps through his strong navy, but in fact he\\'ll be wildly unpopular and people will worry about him being king in all but name. \\n\\nShe will quickly dispatch the puppet fAegon, who I see as the Lady Jane Grey figure -- especially if he\\'s truly a Blackfyre descendent through the female line. Like Mary I, she will see that he\\'s mostly a puppet of his scheming spouse (Arianne, in this case?) and other courtiers. She won\\'t enjoy the thought of killing her own kin, but like Mary, she\\'ll realize her crown will never be secure while he lives. \\n\\nAfter she takes power, she will have false pregnancies but won\\'t bear a living child. She\\'ll crack down on dissidents by burning them alive, which will weaken support further. She\\'ll also likely oversee a realm stricken by hunger and illness -- the famine awaiting Westeros this winter has been heavily foreshadowed, and we\\'ve also had numerous accounts of plagues in \"Fire and Blood\" and ASOIAF.\\n\\nIf she becomes aware of Jon\\'s true parentage, she, like Mary, will worry about how people may use that information to betray her. (She may try to imprison him as Mary imprisoned her sister, or maybe, if she\\'s single at that point, she\\'ll try to marry him to unite their claims.) Like Mary, Dany will die childless. Just as Mary grudgingly named Elizabeth her heir, so may Dany ultimately admit that Jon is her only realistic heir.\\n\\nJon, like Elizabeth, was born after his father apparently set aside his first wife after realizing she couldn\\'t bear further children. Like Elizabeth, he will probably face critics who say his parents\\' marriage isn\\'t valid. But also like Elizabeth, he\\'d be following an enormously unpopular monarch and perhaps benefitting from an \"anyone is better than her\" attitude and even some good luck (a dream of spring!)\\n\\nAnd thus Dany, like Mary, is thus likely to be succeeded by someone she\\'d consider a bastard, but who will do a better job ruling than she would. \\n\\n(Here is where I think the parallels end. Elizabeth ruled for decades and remains one of England\\'s greatest all-time monarchs -- arguably *the* greatest. Jon is likely to reign only briefly, IMO, in \"Hour of the Wolf\" fashion.) \\n\\nThanks for reading!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'In A Clash of Kings Daenerys IV, Dany visits the House of the Undying. She sees many different visions, one of which goes as follows;\\n\\n\"***a beautiful*** ***woman*** *sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her. They had* ***rattish*** *pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another* ***savaged her breasts****, worrying at the nipples with his* ***wet red mouth****,* ***tearing and chewing****\" (ACOK Dany IV).* \\n\\nThis woman represents Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, which at this point in time is ravaging the realm. However, there is also a specific identity that may fit for our symbolic woman: *Cersei Lannister*\\n\\nTo begin, Cersei is specifically described using the word \"beautiful\" through 10 different POV\\'s (by my count). There are loads of examples, but the best one is in Kevan\\'s POV;\\n\\n\"*Ser Kevan remembered the girl she once had been, so full of life and mischief. And when she\\'d flowered, ahhhh … had there ever been a maid so sweet to look upon? If Aerys had agreed to marry her to Rhaegar, how many deaths might have been avoided? Cersei could have given the prince the sons he wanted, lions with purple eyes and silver manes … and with such a wife, Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark. The northern girl had a wild* ***beauty****, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never match the rising sun\" (ADWD Kevan Epilogue).*\\n\\nIt\\'s not a hard sell to fit Cersei as \"the beautiful woman\". The real evidence comes in Cersei I AFFC:\\n\\n*\"She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all.*\\n\\n*The courtiers were brightly colored* ***mice*** *below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked.*\\n\\n *Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne* ***bit into her flesh*** *as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as* ***steel teeth gnawed*** *at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her,* ***tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly****, slicing at her arms and legs until they were* ***slick and red, glistening****\" (Cersei I AFFC).*\\n\\nThe beautiful naked woman in the House of the Undying represents how War and the struggle for the Iron Throne are tearing apart the realm. In Cersei\\'s nightmare, she herself is a beautiful naked woman and the Iron Throne tears her apart, alluding to her inevitable downfall.\\n\\nThe verbiage used in the two passages is *shockingly similar.* In Dany\\'s vision, a beautiful naked woman has **rattish men** savage at her breasts. **Tearing and chewing with wet red mouths.**\\n\\nIn Cersei\\'s nightmare, the supplicants below are described as **mice**. The Iron Throne **tears** chunks from Cersei\\'s breasts and belly. It bites her and slices her arms and legs until they are **slick and red**.\\n\\nIt seems as though George is repeating the imagery from the House of the Undying in Cersei\\'s nightmare. In both cases, a beautiful woman is torn apart by the struggle for power. So while the woman from Dany\\'s vision might not *specifically* be Cersei Lannister.... *she might as well be.*',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'This is only a semi-serious post about something that just came to me randomly while working. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"...and boy lords are the bane of any House.\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRoose Bolton said those words, and they\\'re not without their wisdom. Young lordlings aren\\'t exactly known for sensible decision-making, not to mention the vacuum of power they create around them with would-be regents and lords protector trying to grasp for that time in the sun in the period when the lord is not of age.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut one thing we know for almost a certainty is that Brandon Stark will end up king. Maybe king in the Iron Throne, maybe Harrenhal as others theorized, or maybe anywhere else; whichever it is, this obviously underage lord will wear the crown, and underage kings need a regent, maybe even more than one, as with Aegon III. Of course, as pretty much the strongest magical character by the story\\'s end with a seemingly infinite pool of knowledge to draw from, Bran might not really *need* a regent. Or maybe he does, depending on what kind of person he is by then.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut he will not necessarily be the only major lord who is a minor, right? Let\\'s look at some of the Seven Kingdoms.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The north**: It is greatly accepted that Sansa being Queen in the North is utter bull, especially since her brother is king down south (I actually agree with this). There is no way the lords of the north would abandon Bran amongst the southron lords, and neither will Sansa, let\\'s be real. So if not Bran, then Winterfell will go to one of his siblings. Going by the suggestion of the show, that will be Sansa, who is older, but will also still most likely be a minor when that time comes. Boy lords or ruling girl ladies, Roose Bolton\\'s quote above still applies. And if not Sansa, there is no guarantee that Rickon dies in the books. Maybe it goes to *him*.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Vale**: Littlefinger has laid out his plans to Alayne in AFFC, all that about marrying her off to Ser Harrold Hardyng after Robert\\'s death, which I take to mean that it the arrangement will absolutely not happen. Robert was alive by the show\\'s end, but that is no assurance. Robert Arryn practically a minor character (in a major in-universe role, but still), and the chance is good that GRRM may have neglected to tell D&amp;D his fate.\\n\\nBut what if he lives? Of all the seven (nine?) high lords we start with, it\\'s just poetic madness that *he* of all people is the one to make it to the end (I don\\'t see Mace and Doran doing the same). Sansa could even end up marrying *him* (if Rickon ascends to Winterfell), to secure the Vale in support of Bran.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The stormlands**: Okay, I\\'ll be honest, I don\\'t see Gendry ever getting close to Storm\\'s End. And if a Baratheon is needed to appease the storm lords, there is Edric Storm, a castle-raised and educated lordling who, despite his bastardy, is actually noble on both sides, and will thus appeal more to the sensibilities of the highborn. He is around the same age as Sansa, I think? So if he makes it, he will most likely still be a minor at the end of the series.\\n\\nBran could legitimize him, I suppose (because let\\'s be real, Daenerys will never do such a thing) in exchange for a pledge of fealty and the condition that he sets aside all claims for himself and his children, blah blah. Of course, oaths are only in place until it\\'s inconvenient, but who knows? Edric seems a decent enough kid, if a bit pampered, so probably *he* at least will not be any trouble to Bran.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Dorne**: With Arianne going to \"beard the dragon in its den\" in TWOW, she will most definitely be part of Aegon\\'s court (such as it is) in Storm\\'s End, and maybe eventually in King\\'s Landing. Which doesn\\'t really bode well for her, when Daenerys comes into the picture and King\\'s Landing goes up in smoke, accidentally or not. Like I said above, I don\\'t see Doran surviving the series, though I cannot really say why. He is definitely in a safer spot than Mace Tyrell at the moment, but who knows? *If* Doran survives, all well and good, and if not, then next is Arianne, who is on a much trickier spot.\\n\\nAnd *if* she goes, well, next in line is Prince Trystane. And quite frankly, of all the possibilities I\\'ve listed here, this is the one I *really* don\\'t want to happen because of its problematic connotations. Dorne sets itself apart from the rest of Westeros for its equal primogeniture, and I\\'m not comfortable with the narrative idea of the female heir dying to make place for the younger brother. And yeah, I know this argument can be seen as veering towards political correctness, which can be a touchy subject for a lot of people. I don\\'t ascribe to Political Correctness Gone Mad, I promise, guys.\\n\\nAnyway, Trystane is around the same age as Edric Storm, so yeah, boy lord.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The riverlands**: R\\'hllor save me, but I actually see Edmure surviving, so I didn\\'t really give this much thought. But if not? Well, his wife is pregnant. Assuming she safely gives birth, then that child (boy *or* girl) will have the strongest claim to Riverrun when Edmure dies. Very unlikely, I think, but hey.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd that\\'s pretty much it. I know I said this is semi-serious, but the words just kept coming when I started typing. What do you think? There\\'s still the Reach, the west, and the Iron Islands, but there\\'s really no prominent young character from those regions that we\\'ve heard of. I\\'ve heard the Tyrek theory, but that\\'s pretty much it.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So I haven’t ever seen this discussed but...everyone is probably on the same page as far as Dunk never having received knighthood, right?  It’s pretty clear that his hesitation to knight Fossoway was because he was worried about what might happen to him if he was ever found out to have never been knighted.\\n\\nSo I want to know what people are predicting about this issue.  How and when do you think Dunk will be knighted?\\n\\nI personally think there are a myriad of scenarios, but given that his lack of knighthood seems not to be part of historical record, it was probably done secretly.  What I’m certain of, however, is that the issue will arise much farther down the road, when Egg earns his knighthood.  He will insist that he will be dubbed by Dunk and no one else, of course.  What will Dunk do?\\n\\nWell, depending on the time it occurs, I think that Maekar is a good candidate for giving Dunk his knighthood.  Possibly dubbing him without Egg ever knowing there was a problem.\\n\\nOR\\n\\nDunk will finally confess to Egg that, over all these years and through everything they’ve done, he never was a knight in the first place.  So Egg will be knighted by his father, and then Egg will dub Dunk, in a sweet reversal.\\n\\nOR\\n\\nThere’s also a possibility that Dunk sidesteps the issue of Egg’s knighthood, however unlikely.  If so, then the issue will arise again when Egg tries to make Dunk his Kingsguard.  This will prompt Dunk to confess his unworthiness, and then Egg, as king, will dub Dunk.\\n\\nBut maybe Bloodraven could knight him?  For some reason?  I want to hear what people think about this and what theories are out there!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Recently I began reading Fire &amp; Blood and just finished the “Year of the Three Brides” chapter in which Rogar Baratheon marries Queen Alyssa, plots to have Princess Alysanne wed to his younger brother, and nearly attacks Jaehaerys and his Kingsguard when he arrives to Dragonstone shortly after the young king’s wedding. \\n\\nWhile Rogar himself was essential in crowning Jaehaerys at Storm’s End as well as bringing an end to Maegor the Cruel’s reign, I think his support of Jaehaerys was a front to gain control of the throne and elevate his house’s power and status from the beginning. He was willing to go as far as to endanger the blood of the king he swore to protect when he orders his men to seize Jaehaerys. Rogar views himself as THE King at this point, not just the Hand to the King. \\n\\n&gt; But as the his men moved forward, the seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard stepped up and drew their swords. “Come no closer,” warned Ser Gyles Morrigen. “Any man who lays a hand on our king and queen shall die today.”  Lord Rogar was dismayed. “Sheath your steel and move aside,” he commanded. “Have you forgotten? I am the King’s Hand.”  “Aye,” old Sour Sam answered, “but we’re the Kingsguard, not the Hand’s guard, and it’s the lad who sits the chair, not you.”  Rogar Baratheon bristled and Ser Samgood’s words, and answered, “You are seven. I have half a hundred swords behind me. A word from me and they will cut you to pieces.”  “They might kill us,” replied you by Pate the Woodcock, brandishing his spear, “but you will be the first to die, m’lord, you have my word upon that.”\\n\\n\\nThis moment is extremely tense and shows just how far Rogar was willing to go in order to maintain his power. If Queen Alyssa hadn’t stepped in, this fight could have gone any number of ways. Would Rogar have any chance of surviving the 7 Kingsguard before his men joined the battle? If he had been successful in taking Jaehaerys and Alyssane, would he essentially be ruling in place of the King?',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"In Eddard VII of A Game of Thrones, Ned convinces the king not to fight in the melee for the Hand's tourney after he had been adamant on doing so. Ned is later visited in secret by a disguised Lord Varys. Varys reveals to Ned that the Lannisters had plotted to kill King Robert during the melee, and that Ned's interference likely saved the king's life... for the time being.\\n\\nAnything the Spider says should always be taken with a grain of salt, but let's assume for the sake of argument that Varys was actually being truthful about this plot... What would have happened if Ned hadn't been able to keep Robert from fighting in the melee? And if Robert had died that day instead?\\n\\nKing Robert I Baratheon would have been killed earlier in the story, before Ned Stark had learned the truth about the parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. Ned would have been forced to accept Joffrey as king without challenging his claim. He then likely would have been removed from his office as Hand of the King in favor of Tywin Lannister. Tywin becomes Hand prior to war breaking out and comes to King's Landing.\\n\\nMost of this seems pretty straightforward to me. What is not straightforward is what would have happened to House Stark with Tirion being already abducted by Catelyn and taken to the Vale. Tirion's story likely would have played out much the same since no one in King's Landing knew where he had been taken (although Varys likely would have found out quickly enough; but who knows what Varys would have done with that situation). Still, Tirion likely still wins free from captivity and returns to King's Landing of his own accord.\\n\\nTirion's abduction becomes much more indefensible with Tywin as Hand instead of Eddard Stark, and Tywin may have punished the Starks in ways other than war. I can see a scenario playing out where the Starks have to give up lands to the crown, Ned is forced to take the black, Sansa and Arya remain in King's Landing as hostages against northern rebellion. And then the War of the Five Kings never really starts.\\n\\nAnd maybe Ned figures out the truth later, when it is too late, and is unable to do anything about King Joffrey after he's been crowned. Maybe Stannis still makes a play for the throne — and maybe Renly as well — but the war does not begin with North involved. And if the North is not a part of the fighting, maybe Balon Greyjoy and the ironborn attack the Westerlands instead of the North. Or maybe the Starks do eventually rebel but in support of Stannis — which likely could easily have resulted in King Stannis I Baratheon on the Iron Throne...\\n\\nThoughts?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Reposting as I had to fix the title: \\n\\nSo a recent post asking if Ned would actually take the Black or rebel, got me thinking...\\n\\nHow does the story play out with Ned taking the Black as planned? But for that to happen, my only actual assumption is there is no execution, which requires LF to have another agenda or means of sowing chaos.\\n\\nSetting the stage of where each character was at the time of Ned's confession and what's the immediate implication:\\n\\nNed - Confesses and takes the Black. I don't think he travels with Yoren and co. A la Bloodraven, he is shipped to Eastwatch under guard. This would be pretty interesting as there are a number of Targ supporters (Thorne) at the Wall. Also, Ned's internal conflicts hearing news of Robb's actions. What may be most likely is his release to go North is conditional on Robb bending the knee (see Robb's section below). Even so, I'm curious as to what happens with him at the Wall.\\n\\nArya - Was in the audience watching confession. Probably still taken by Yoren as he was a Varys agent and it appears Varys had no idea about LF execution plot. Does being less emotionally distraught make her more or less careful/cautious? The importance of getting home is the same so does this make her more careful as she has more optimism and more to gain, or less because she has less fear?\\n\\n\\\\*Sansa - On steps with Royal family. I think her and Robb's reactions are most interesting. Without the betrayal of Joffrey, she is likely much more amenable to coercion and may act as a dividing force within Stark family, taking the Lannister stance.\\n\\n\\\\*Robb - Just won Whispering Woods and Battle of the Camps at Riverrun; has Jaime hostage. A lot of strategic decisions going on here. I doubt Cersei sends off Ned until Robb bends the knee. A bargaining chip like Jaime changes everything though. Cersei values Jaime more than Tywin does, if Tywin remains in the field, Cersei may agree to unfavorable terms, even releasing Ned from taking the Black? What are KitN implications?\\n\\nBran - Already awake and managing Winterfell with Luwin's guidance\\n\\nRickon - Just some crazy kid running around Winterfell\\n\\nJon - Ned's execution is when he goes on his night ride. Probably stays at the Wall but has less internal conflicts, how does he change without those? Still goes on the great ranging, but does anything change?\\n\\nCat - Is with Robb when Ned confesses. Probably the biggest proponent for peace and negotiation. Does her involvement weaken Robb's bargaining power and would there be conflict there? Is she still sent to treat with Renly?\\n\\nTheon - Is with Robb when Ned confesses. Does Robb send him to treat with Balon still? Balon definitely still plans on crowning himself King so if Theon stays with Robb, how does it play out?\\n\\nCersei - How does finding out about Jaime's capture while still holding Ned change her decision making?\\n\\nJoffrey - How does he treat Sansa differently with her father alive? How would he feel about Cersei considering giving up Ned for an uncle he doesn't really care about?\\n\\nTywin - Does he stay in the field, sending Tyrion to KL or go himself?\\n\\nTyrion - Does he go to KL and does he try to break Jaime out still?\\n\\nStannis - At Dragonstone and knows about twincest. Didn't care about Ned but had a begrudging respect for him.\\n\\nRenly - I doubt anything changes until Cat visits him as he is pretty darn full of himself. Will his conversations with Cat change?\\n\\nJaime - Captured. Does he have more hope knowing Ned is alive and would be a good trade? He probably gave up hope when Joff killed Ned so may be more calm as he thinks he has a chance now.\\n\\nRickard Karstark - Does he kill the Lannister prisoners? Does his fury hold back knowing his actions could get Ned killed?\\n\\nLF - Why would he decide not to get Joff to execute? What would be another agenda?\\n\\nVarys - He may believe his delay tactics coming from his convo with Illryio are working.\\n\\nI'll stop here at just setting the stage. Agree/disagree? What are the longer term ramifications?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"So a recent post asking if Ned would actually take the Black or rebel, got me thinking...\\n\\nHow does the story play out with Ned taking the Black as planned? My only assumption is there is no execution, which I only see possible if LF has another agenda or another means of sowing chaos.\\n\\nSettting the stage of where each character was at the time of Ned's confession and what's the immediate implication:\\n\\nNed - Confesses and takes the Black. I don't think he travels with Yoren and co. A la Bloodraven, he is shipped to Eastwatch under guard. This would be pretty interesting as there are a number of Targ supporters (Thorne) at the Wall. Also, Ned's internal conflicts hearing news of Robb's actions. Orrrr (see Robb's section below)...\\n\\nArya - Was in the audience watching confession. Probably still taken by Yoren as he was a Varys agent and it appears Varys had no idea about LF execution plot. Does being less.emotionally distraught make her more or less careful/cautious? The importance of getting home is the same so does this make her more careful as she has more optimism and more to gain, or less because she has less fear?\\n\\nSansa - On steps with Royal family. I think her and Robb's reactions are most interesting. Without the betrayal of Joffrey, she is likely much more amenable to coercion and may act as a dividing force within Stark family, taking the Lannister stance.\\n\\nRobb - Just won Whispering Woods and Battle of the Camps at Riverrun; has Jaime hostage. A lot of strategic decisions going on here. I doubt Cersei sends off Ned until Robb bends the knee.  A bargaining chip like Jaime changes everything though. Cersei values Jaime more than Tywin does, if Tywin remains in the field, Cersei may agree to unfavorable terms, even releasing Ned from taking the Black? What are KitN implications?\\n\\nBran - Already awake and managing Winterfell with Luwin's guidance\\n\\nRickon - Just some crazy kid running around Winterfell\\n\\nJon - Ned's execution is when he goes on his night ride. Probably stays at the Wall but has less internal conflicts, how does he change without those? Still goes on the great ranging, but does anything change?\\n\\nCat - Is with Robb when Ned confesses. Probably the biggest proponent for peace and negotiation. Does her involvement weaken Robb's bargaining power and would there be conflict there? Is she still sent to treat with Renly?\\n\\nTheon - Is with Robb when Ned confesses. Does Robb send him to treat with Balon still? Balon definitely still plans on crowning himself King so if Theon stays with Robb, how does it play out?\\n\\nCersei - How does finding out about Jaime's capture while still holding Ned change her decision making?\\n\\nJoffrey - How does he treat Sansa differently with her father alive? How would he feel about Cersei considering giving up Ned for an uncle he doesn't really care about?\\n\\nTywin - Does he stay in the field, sending Tyrion to KL or go himself? \\n\\nTyrion - Does he go to KL and does he try to break Jaime out still?\\n\\nStannis - At Dragonstone and knows about twincest. Didn't care about Ned but had a begrudging respect for him.\\n\\nRenly - I doubt anything changes until Cat visits him as he is pretty darn full of himself. Will his conversations with Cat change?\\n\\nJaime - Captured. Does he have more hope knowing Ned is alive and would be a good trade? He probably have up hope when Joff killed Ned so may be more calm as he thinks he has a chance now.\\n\\nRickard Karstark - Does he kill the Lannister prisoners? Does his fury hold back knowing his actions could get Ned killed?\\n\\nLF - Why would he decide not to get Joff to execute? What would be another agenda?\\n\\nVarys - He may believe his delay tactics coming from his convo with Illryio are working.\\n\\nI'll stop here at just setting the stage. Agree/disagree? What are the longer term ramifications?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The problem to me, starts with the end of season 6.\\n\\nIf you look at the map, there\\'s shit all happening.\\n\\nTo start writing, season 7, you have the following:\\n\\n- Dany + Her army heading to Westeros, united\\n- Jon + Starks, united (some are about to arrive home, aka Bran)\\n- Lannisters + gang at King\\'s landing, united (Euron about to arrive)\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the key problem. The three main storylines that have lasted for 6 seasons are mostly solved. There\\'s virtually no conflict in each location anymore. No more fighting in King\\'s Landing.\\n\\nWho is Cersie meant to talk to in King\\'s Landing, the only NAMED characters there are who? Jamie, Qyburn and a zombie Mountain? \\n\\nWhat\\'s meant to happen up North, Jon Snow took back Winterfell, there\\'s 0 reason for people to really overthrow him, all he can do is prepare for the fight. \\n\\nAnd Dany is the same thing, she\\'s a queen with a giant army ready to invade. \\n\\nPeople aren\\'t really stuck in the country side or rallying people to their course or trying to return home. It\\'s mostly all done.\\n\\nBest conflict you can get is Dorne and Greyjoys fighting or something, all very low level stuff (aka show Arya fighting with Sansa).\\n\\n\\nI feel like this is where you have to introduce new characters, which considering the story, its super late to start introducing characters now.  This gaping hole in the story is where all the characters cut from the show start to fill in the gaps.\\n\\nThere could be a problems with Cersie becoming queen of the 7 kingdoms, but there was no characters to really put that story in motion. Same with how theres not really any Lords of the Eyrie to help with any plot there (Robin could ask for a problematic \"thanks\" gift, for saving them at BotB).\\n\\nIt just feels like too many characters were cut, which left them only to mash the 3 locations together with plot and hope for the best. They could introduce new characters, but considering it\\'s now season 7, it would defs feel pretty awkward.',\n",

The true hell for humanity has not yet started, if the 3eyedRaven which truely is using Bran as a vessel(what a failure of writing and acting) can figure out a way reliably breed greenseer children to replace Bran as hosts and can find dragon eggs or somehow breed dragons . Medival possibly eternal Skynet with omnipresent surveillance is coming..................... The winner of the game of thrones was The Three Eyed Raven!   And the more I think about it the Star Wars prequels and The Clone Wars!\\n\\n2.Some badly bungled twist that was probably pretty original in the fantasy market of the late 90s, turns out two major fan favorite characters are really (admittedly some of the best ever) villain origin stories. Oh and the unbeatable army of demons and zombies? BOOM not the real threat all along like you thought, its the human heart and power and politics that ARE the real danger, not the others(see what I did there wink wink nudge nudge)\\n\\n3.Some weird retelling of Lord Of The Rings with Drogon as the one ring I guess?

       "   'selftext': 'So a couple of months ago I made a post getting a bit upset over the deaths of Aemon, Baelon, and Alyssa( [Here is a Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dzdkg2/spoilers_extended_am_i_the_only_one_who_gets/)) Also of this is a bit tinfoily\\n\\nNow, this is a theory I had with no evidence a couple of months ago. Then I was watching the order of the green hand video and it gave me some of the evidence. Also, this theory was helped developed by  [**u/Daemon-RoguePrince**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Daemon-RoguePrince/)**.**\\n\\nThroughout Fire and Blood, the phrase \"It was not to be\" is used only two times in total. They are used when describing the deaths of Alyssa and Baelon. Aemon\\'s is also suspicious but that will be investigated last.\\n\\nSo let\\'s first start out with Alyssa\\n\\n&gt;It was not to be. Alyssa Targaryen had a warrior’s heart in a woman’s body, and her strength failed her. She never fully recovered from Aegon’s birth, and died within the year at only four-and-twenty. Nor did Prince Aegon long survive her.\\n\\nWe must also note how she wanted to make 20 sons right after this. Or have 20 sons.\\n\\n&gt;Princess Alyssa was brought to bed again in 84 AC. After a long and difficult labor, she gave Prince Baelon a third son, a boy they named Aegon, after the Conqueror. “They call me Baelon the Brave,” the prince told his wife at her bedside, “but you are far braver than me. I would sooner fight a dozen battles than do what you’ve just done.” Alyssa laughed at him. “You were made for battles, and I was made for this. Viserys and Daemon and Aegon, that’s three. As soon as I am well, let’s make another. I want to give you twenty sons. An army of your own!”\\n\\nNow she says as soon as she is well. We must assume that this just means as soon as she recovers from labor, which given how she took her newborns on dragons days later, doesn\\'t take her too long. This is not something an ill person would say. Alysanne after she went on bed rest for 6 months following the birth of Valerion. She wanted no more children after this. Also, there is no record of Alyssa citing herself sick or having childbed fever.\\n\\nNext up is Baelon\\n\\n&gt;It was not to be. In 101 AC Prince Baelon complained of a stitch in his side whilst hunting in the kingswood. The pain worsened when he returned to the city. His belly swelled and hardened, and the pain grew so severe it left him bedridden. Runciter, the new Grand Maester only recently arrived from the Citadel after Allar was felled by a stroke, was able to bring the prince’s fever down somewhat and give him some relief from agony with milk of the poppy, but his condition continued to worsen. On the fifth day of his illness, Prince Baelon died in his bedchamber in the Tower of the Hand, with his father sitting beside him, holding his hand. After opening the corpse, Grand Maester Runciter put down the cause of death as a burst belly.\\n\\nThis one is even more suspicious one might say. Now the obvious answer for this is appendicitis. But things are rarely straightforward as they seem to be. For this, there are two factors to consider. One is the factor is that there was a new grand maester. This will be a fact better described when I say the overarching theory. The second part is there have been multiple suspicious deaths via sudden belly pain. Aenys I first started complaining of belly pains before his death. There have been many theories that he was poisoned whether by the maesters or Visenya. Damon the Devout also died suspiciously of a bad belly.\\n\\nNow onto Aemon.\\n\\n&gt;One of the Myrish scouts wound his crossbow now, behind the rocks where he was hidden. Rising, he took aim on the Evenstar a hundred yards below, and loosed his bolt. Dusk and distance made his aim less certain, and the bolt missed Lord Cameron…and struck Prince Aemon, standing at his side. The iron bolt punched through the prince’s throat and out the back of his neck. The Prince of Dragonstone fell to his knees and grasped the crossbow bolt, as if to pull it from his throat, but his strength was gone. Aemon Targaryen died struggling to speak, drowned on his own blood. He was thirty-seven years old.\\n\\nNow here is where the overarching conspiracy comes from. With Aemon how do we know it was Myrish Scouts? There is no record of the scouts being collected and imprisoned. Also, how do we know he was aiming for the Evenstar of Taarth. What if this was a story concocted by the maesters to upset the succession. What if Baelon didn\\'t truly die of appendicitis, but a poison. What if Alyssa didn\\'t die from childbirth, but from poison. It was not to be. We must assess that quote and the wording of it Why was it not to be. Because the Grey Rats writing the history say as such. We hear nothing of the scouts being imprisoned. Or executed. That would be important news to hear. We hear nothing of their confession. So how do we know who they were aiming at? And why would they aim at the Evenstar? What is the wiser move? A lord or a dragonrider. Baelon had an autopsy, but I doubt any watched him do it. He could do it and then just make up the cause of death. Or maybe the poison caused appendicitis. The Maesters have access to nearly all poisons. Alyssa wanted an army of sons. That would not be good for the rock hard succession they are trying to disrupt. So to stop her from having any more sons or children in general, Dragonriders too, they poisoned her after she gave birth to little Aegon and then killed her afterward. They could easily blame it on her being weakened from childbirth. All to upset the rock hard line of succession that existed.',\n",

From that i think his goal was to either capture or kill Renly as he was the glue that kept his army together, once he is gone his army is going to start routing or even change side and if he manages to capture Loras as well he has the Tyrells by the balls.

ASoIaF quotes from asearchoficeandfire.com.)\\n\\nThree old wise women are a recurring theme in mythology and literature.\\n\\nOften these three woman determine the destinies of men and gods. The Graeae of Greece known as “the grey ones”; the Moirai of Greece, or the Parcae or fates, the Roman evolution into the personification of destiny, past present and future; and the Norse Norns who ruled the destinies of gods and men watering the world tree Yggdrasill from the Well of Urdr (Well of Fate); and the Irish Morrigan, often described as a trio of individuals, all sisters, called \"the three Morrígna\".\\n\\n**The Graeae**\\n\\nThe Graeae were daughters of the sea-deities Phorcys and Ceto (from which their name the Phorcydes derived), and sisters to the Gorgons. The Graeae took the form of old, grey-haired women. Their age was so great that a human childhood for them was hardly conceivable. the \"well-clad\" Pemphredo (Πεμφρηδώ \"alarm\") and the \"saffron-robed\" Enyo (Ἐνυώ \"horror\" the \"waster of cities\" who also had an identity separate from this sisterhood) and Deino (Δεινώ \"dread\", the dreadful anticipation of horror). They shared one eye and one tooth, which they took turns using and were beings on whom no ray of sun ever looks down, nor moon at night. By stealing their eye while they were passing it among themselves, the hero Perseus forced them to tell the whereabouts of the three objects needed to kill Medusa (in other versions the whereabouts of Medusa) by ransoming their shared eye for the information. Hesiod says, “the Graiai, with fair faces and gray from birth, and these the gods who are immortal and men who walk on the earth call Graiai, the gray sisters, Pemphredo robed in beauty and Enyo robed in saffron.”\\n\\n**The Moirai**\\n\\nClotho (/ˈkloʊθoʊ/, Greek Κλωθώ [klɔːtʰɔ̌ː] \"spinner\") spun the thread of life from her distaff onto her spindle. Her Roman equivalent was Nona (\"the ninth\"), who was originally a goddess called upon in the ninth month of pregnancy.\\n\\nLachesis (/ˈlækɪsɪs/, Greek Λάχεσις [lákʰesis] \"allotter\" or drawer of lots) measured the thread of life allotted to each person with her measuring rod. Her Roman equivalent was Decima (\"the Tenth\"). Normally seen clothed in white.\\n\\nAtropos (/ˈætrəpɒs/, Greek Ἄτροπος [átropos] \"inexorable\" or \"inevitable\", literally \"unturning\", sometimes called Aisa) was the cutter of the thread of life. She chose the manner of each person\\'s death; and when their time was come, she cut their life-thread with \"her abhorred shears\". Her Roman equivalent was Morta (\"the dead one\").\\n\\n**The Morrígan**\\n\\nThe Morrígan is often described as a trio of individuals, all sisters, called \"the three Morrígna\". Membership of the triad varies; sometimes it is given as Badb, Macha and Nemain. Mor may derive from an Indo-European root connoting terror, monstrousness cognate with the Old English maere (which survives in the modern English word \"nightmare\") and the Scandinavian mara and the Old East Slavic \"mara\" (\"nightmare\"); while rígan translates as \"queen\". This etymological sequence can be reconstructed in the Proto-Celtic language as *Moro-rīganī-s.  Accordingly, Morrígan is often translated as \"Phantom Queen\". Her role was to not only be a symbol of imminent death, but to also influence the outcome of war. Most often, she did this by appearing as a crow flying overhead, and would either inspire fear or courage in the hearts of the warriors. In some cases, she is written to have appeared in visions to those who are destined to die in battle as washing their bloody armor. In this specific role, she is also given the role of foretelling imminent death with a particular emphasis on the individual. There are also a few rare accounts where she would join in the battle itself as a warrior and show her favoritism in a more direct manner.\\n\\n**The Norns**\\n\\nThe Norns are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men in Norse Mythology. The Völuspá, Prophecy of the Völva (Seeress), is the first and best known poem of the Poetic Edda. It tells the story of the creation of the world and its coming end.  Urðr (Wyrd), Verðandi and Skuld, the three most important of the Norns, come out from a hall standing at the Well of Urðr or Well of Fate. They draw water from the well and take sand that lies around it, which they pour over the Yggdrasill tree so that its branches will not rot. These three Norns are described as powerful maiden giantesses (Jotuns) whose arrival from Jötunheimr ended the golden age of the gods. Beside these three famous Norns, there are many others who appear at a person\\'s birth in order to determine his or her future. In the pre-Christian Norse societies, Norns were thought to have visited newborn children. There were both malevolent and benevolent Norns: the former caused all the malevolent and tragic events in the world while the latter were kind and protective goddesses.\\n\\nThe Poetic Edda says about them (which I found interesting in this context):\\n\\n*Fafnir spake:*\\n*\"Of many births the Norns must be, Nor one in race they were; Some to gods, others to elves are kin, And Dvalin\\'s daughters some.\"*\\n\\nThe three wise women of Westeros do not appear to be sisters at all, but rather “of many births”, and one is literally a dwarf (Dvalin’s daughter).\\n\\nI would contend that the following three wise old woman of Westeros can be loosely equated to the various aspects of the these mythological trinities:\\n\\n**Old Nan:**\\n\\n*“She was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak to climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew how old she was, but his father said she\\'d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the oldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him.”* -Game of Thrones, Bran IV\\n\\nPemphredo – alarm – she who guides the way – the well clad or robed in beauty\\n\\nThe Grey Ones are ancient, although they may have once been “fair cheeked” or beautiful. I suspect Old Nan is Shiera Seastar, which fits with once being beautiful, being “well clad” or dressed which is one of the few descriptors we get of Seastar, and there is the Sea-god connection in her name. If I’m right and Nan is the three eyed crow, she also attempted to show Bran the way. Nan is also Toothless and is nearly blind (eye color never given), but has a ‘third eye’, and smells dragons when discussing the comet.\\n\\nClotho – The Past – The Spinner – The Ninth - Nona\\n\\nOld Nan is incredibly old, tells stories of the past, is always sowing (click click click), and originally came to Winterfell to care for a newborn Brandon Stark (the ninth is a reference to the nine months of maternity leading to childbirth).\\n\\nBadb – Crow – prophesized the worlds end – “bean-sidhe” ( is a female spirit in Irish mythology who heralds the death of a family member, usually by wailing, shrieking, or keening.)\\n\\n*\"I dreamed about the crow again last night. The one with three eyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did. We went down to the crypts. Father was there, and we talked. He was sad.\"* – Game of Thrones, Bran VII\\n\\nObviously this is tied to my belief that Old Nan is the Three Eyed Crow, who is a messenger of death, and warns of the worlds end, “and now you know why you must live”.\\n\\nUrdr – fate – Past – Urd’s well is the “well of fate”\\n\\n*\"You be quiet, stupid,\" the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. \"It\\'s just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and run tell Father?\" She knelt and pulled her brother from the pool, but before she got him out again, the two of them were gone.*\\n\\n*After that the glimpses came faster and faster, till Bran was feeling lost and dizzy. He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her. Then there came a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor. A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows. The tree itself was shrinking, growing smaller with each vision, whilst the lesser trees dwindled into saplings and vanished, only to be replaced by other trees that would dwindle and vanish in their turn. And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them.* -Dance with Dragons, Bran III\\n\\nNan is not only a fixture of Winterfell, with its heart tree above the still cold pool, but she is always telling stories of the past, and even featured in a vision of the past through the tree of Winterfell including the pool.\\n\\n**Ghost of High Heart**:\\n\\n*Beside the embers of their campfire, she saw Tom, Lem, and Greenbeard talking to a tiny little woman, a foot shorter than Arya and older than Old Nan, all stooped and wrinkled and leaning on a gnarled black cane. Her white hair was so long it came almost to the ground. When the wind gusted it blew about her head in a fine cloud. Her flesh was whiter, the color of milk, and it seemed to Arya that her eyes were red, though it was hard to tell from the bushes. \"The old gods stir and will not let me sleep,\"*\\n\\nDeino – Dread – the terrible\\n\\n*\"I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,\" the dwarf woman was saying. \"I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.\" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. \"You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now.\"* – Storm of Swords, Arya VIII\\n\\nIt should be noted that not only is the Ghost of High heart giving dread prophesies here, but a maid with serpents in her hair sounds a lot like a medusa, whom the grey ones pointed Perseus to in legend.\\n\\nLachesis – The present - The allotter – Measurer with her rod – Garbed in white - The Tenth – Decima\\n\\nShe has her gnarled black cane, and is pale as milk, which match wth the measurure and garbed in white. Decima/Lachesis was in charge of determining the length of mortals’ lives, and along with Nona attended childbirths. It should be noted that the tragedy at Summerhall, to which the Ghost of High Heart refers when speaking to Arya, was the time and place of Rhaegar’s birth. She also predicted the promised prince would be of the line of Aerys and Rhaella.\\n\\nMacha – sovereignty goddess - the land, fertility, kingship, war and horses – of the plain - \"the mast of Macha\"\\n\\nIt should be noted that High Heart itself is situated as the lone highpoint amidst a flat plain, giving clear line of sight all around. It was a sacred place to the Children of the Forest.\\n\\n“The Mast of Macha” refers to the heads of men that have been slaughtered, stacked after a battle, and likely derives from a legend of a mother earth like goddess (Macha) who cared for men (a king) but was horribly mistreated (forced to race horses while pregnant despite pleading for reprieve) and so cursed men and became a war goddess (the masts, berries or nuts of the forest, which fed pigs (fruits of the land) being replaced with the heads of the slaughtered (fruits of battle).\\n\\nHigh heart is also the location of a battle, and subsequent slaughter, then the chopping down of its 31 Weirwoods, resulting in a pile of corpses, or the mast of macha.\\n\\n*The great hill called High Heart was especially holy to the First Men, as it had been to the children of the forest before them. Crowned by a grove of giant weirwoods, ancient as any that had been seen in the Seven Kingdoms, High Heart was still the abode of the children and their greenseers. When the Andal king Erreg the Kinslayer surrounded the hill, the children emerged to defend it, calling down clouds of ravens and armies of wolves...or so the legend tells us. Yet neither tooth nor talon was a match for the steel axes of the Andals, who slaughtered the greenseers, the beasts, and the First Men alike, and raised beside the High Heart a hill of corpses half again as high...or so the singers would have us believe.* - The World of Ice and Fire, The Riverlands\\n\\nVerdandi – happening/becoming – present\\n\\nIt should be noted that the Norns were of many births, one of which was a child of Dvalin (aka a dwarf!) just tlike the ghost of high heart.\\n\\nVerdandi is commonly translated as from the root verda, “in the making”. The prophesies of the Ghost of High Heart are all about events which are in the making, as opposed to Nan’s stories of the past or Maggy’s foretelling deaths themselves.\\n\\n**Maggy the Frog**:\\n\\n*The inside of the tent was full of smells. Cinnamon and nutmeg. Pepper, red and white and black. Almond milk and onions. Cloves and lemongrass and precious saffron, and stranger spices, rarer still. The only light came from an iron brazier shaped like a basilisk\\'s head, a dim green light that made the walls of the tent look cold and dead and rotten. Had it been that way in life as well? Cersei could not seem to remember.*\\n\\n*The sorceress was sleeping in the dream, as once she\\'d slept in life. Leave her be, the queen wanted to cry out. You little fools, never wake a sleeping sorceress. Without a tongue, she could only watch as the girl threw off her cloak, kicked the witch\\'s bed, and said, \"Wake up, we want our futures told.\"* – A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nEnyo – horror – robed in saffron\\n\\n*The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense. Lady Sybell\\'s grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper, almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps. And the grandmother was some woman he\\'d brought back from the east. A frightening old crone, supposed to be a priestess. Maegi, they called her. No one could pronounce her real name. Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the like.\" He shrugged. \"She\\'s long dead, to be sure. And Jeyne seemed a sweet child, I\\'ll grant you, though I only saw her once. But with such doubtful blood . . .\"* -Storm of Swords, Tyrion III\\n\\nNot only does the Tent of Maggy the Frog smell of saffron and spices, but her descendent goes on to found house Spicer. Her eyes are yellow as the eyes of death, and she instills horror in others.\\n\\nAtropos – The Future – Inevitability – Cutter of threads - The Dead One – Morta\\n\\n*\"Some are here who have no futures,\" Maggy muttered in her terrible deep voice. She pulled her robe about her shoulders and beckoned the girls closer. \"Come, if you will not go. Fools. Come, yes. I must taste your blood.\"*\\n\\n*Melara paled, but not Cersei. A lioness does not fear a frog, no matter how old and ugly she might be. She should have gone, she should have listened, she should have run away. Instead she took the dagger Maggy offered her, and ran the twisted iron blade across the ball of her thumb. Then she did Melara too.* - A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nIn order to tell Cersei and the other girls how they will die, they must be cut and let her taste a drop of blood.\\n\\nMorta is responsible for the pain and/or death that occur in a half-wake, half-sleep time frame, and we get this vision through Cersei half remembering and half dreaming.\\n\\nNemain – seize/take/deal out (possibly related to the Greek, “Nemesis”) - frenzied havoc of war - bean nighe or “washerwoman”, an omen of death.\\n\\nIn the grand Irish epic of the Tain Bo Cuailnge, Neman confounds armies, so that friendly bands fall in mutual slaughter.\\n\\nMaggy causes/predicts that Cersei will kill her friend, pushing her down a well. And Maggy’s decedents cause the Red Wedding.\\n\\nMaggy also presents Cersei with “the Valonquar”, her nemesis, who is destined to destroy her.\\n\\n*The old woman\\'s eyes were yellow, and crusted all about with something vile. In Lannisport it was said that she had been young and beautiful when her husband had brought her back from the east with a load of spices, but age and evil had left their marks on her. She was short, squat, and warty, with pebbly greenish jowls. Her teeth were gone and her dugs hung down to her knees. You could smell sickness on her if you stood too close, and when she spoke her breath was strange and strong and foul.* - A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nNot only does she have no teeth, but some distinguishing characteristic of a bean nighe are being short and squat, small and green, and described as having unusually long breasts, or dugs. If caught they will reveal a man’s fate, or grant wishes... depending on the tale.\\n\\nSkuld – debt – future – a Valkyrie\\n\\nSkuld is the youngest of the Norns, as Maggy is the youngest of these three wise women of Westeros. She is both a Norn and a Valkyrie, not only “the one who cuts” or determines lives’ ends, but also marks significant changes, such as marriages and births… both of which are major parts of Maggy’s predictions to Cersei and company. Maggy’s decedents also bring about the Red Wedding, or a feast of the dead, which is what a Valkarie selected soldiers on the battlefield for, to feast in Odin’s Halls. Jeyne Westerling cared for Rob who was injured on the battlefield, before delivering him to the Red Wedding.',\n",

He was sad.\"* – Game of Thrones, Bran VII\\n\\nObviously this is tied to my belief that Old Nan is the Three Eyed Crow, who is a messenger of death, and warns of the worlds end, “and now you know why you must live”.\\n\\nUrdr – fate – Past – Urd’s well is the “well of fate”\\n\\n*\"You be quiet, stupid,\" the girl said, tossing her own branch aside. \"It\\'s just water. Do you want Old Nan to hear and run tell Father?\" She knelt and pulled her brother from the pool, but before she got him out again, the two of them were gone.*\\n\\n*After that the glimpses came faster and faster, till Bran was feeling lost and dizzy. He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her. Then there came a brown-haired girl slender as a spear who stood on the tips of her toes to kiss the lips of a young knight as tall as Hodor. A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows. The tree itself was shrinking, growing smaller with each vision, whilst the lesser trees dwindled into saplings and vanished, only to be replaced by other trees that would dwindle and vanish in their turn. And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them.* -Dance with Dragons, Bran III\\n\\nNan is not only a fixture of Winterfell, with its heart tree above the still cold pool, but she is always telling stories of the past, and even featured in a vision of the past through the tree of Winterfell including the pool.\\n\\n**Ghost of High Heart**:\\n\\n*Beside the embers of their campfire, she saw Tom, Lem, and Greenbeard talking to a tiny little woman, a foot shorter than Arya and older than Old Nan, all stooped and wrinkled and leaning on a gnarled black cane. Her white hair was so long it came almost to the ground. When the wind gusted it blew about her head in a fine cloud. Her flesh was whiter, the color of milk, and it seemed to Arya that her eyes were red, though it was hard to tell from the bushes. \"The old gods stir and will not let me sleep,\"*\\n\\nDeino – Dread – the terrible\\n\\n*\"I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,\" the dwarf woman was saying. \"I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the little bells. I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in her hair, venom dripping from their fangs. And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow.\" She turned her head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya. \"You cannot hide from me, child. Come closer, now.\"* – Storm of Swords, Arya VIII\\n\\nIt should be noted that not only is the Ghost of High heart giving dread prophesies here, but a maid with serpents in her hair sounds a lot like a medusa, whom the grey ones pointed Perseus to in legend.\\n\\nLachesis – The present - The allotter – Measurer with her rod – Garbed in white - The Tenth – Decima\\n\\nShe has her gnarled black cane, and is pale as milk, which match wth the measurure and garbed in white. Decima/Lachesis was in charge of determining the length of mortals’ lives, and along with Nona attended childbirths. It should be noted that the tragedy at Summerhall, to which the Ghost of High Heart refers when speaking to Arya, was the time and place of Rhaegar’s birth. She also predicted the promised prince would be of the line of Aerys and Rhaella.\\n\\nMacha – sovereignty goddess - the land, fertility, kingship, war and horses – of the plain - \"the mast of Macha\"\\n\\nIt should be noted that High Heart itself is situated as the lone highpoint amidst a flat plain, giving clear line of sight all around. It was a sacred place to the Children of the Forest.\\n\\n“The Mast of Macha” refers to the heads of men that have been slaughtered, stacked after a battle, and likely derives from a legend of a mother earth like goddess (Macha) who cared for men (a king) but was horribly mistreated (forced to race horses while pregnant despite pleading for reprieve) and so cursed men and became a war goddess (the masts, berries or nuts of the forest, which fed pigs (fruits of the land) being replaced with the heads of the slaughtered (fruits of battle).\\n\\nHigh heart is also the location of a battle, and subsequent slaughter, then the chopping down of its 31 Weirwoods, resulting in a pile of corpses, or the mast of macha.\\n\\n*The great hill called High Heart was especially holy to the First Men, as it had been to the children of the forest before them. Crowned by a grove of giant weirwoods, ancient as any that had been seen in the Seven Kingdoms, High Heart was still the abode of the children and their greenseers. When the Andal king Erreg the Kinslayer surrounded the hill, the children emerged to defend it, calling down clouds of ravens and armies of wolves...or so the legend tells us. Yet neither tooth nor talon was a match for the steel axes of the Andals, who slaughtered the greenseers, the beasts, and the First Men alike, and raised beside the High Heart a hill of corpses half again as high...or so the singers would have us believe.* - The World of Ice and Fire, The Riverlands\\n\\nVerdandi – happening/becoming – present\\n\\nIt should be noted that the Norns were of many births, one of which was a child of Dvalin (aka a dwarf!) just tlike the ghost of high heart.\\n\\nVerdandi is commonly translated as from the root verda, “in the making”. The prophesies of the Ghost of High Heart are all about events which are in the making, as opposed to Nan’s stories of the past or Maggy’s foretelling deaths themselves.\\n\\n**Maggie the Frog**:\\n\\n*The inside of the tent was full of smells. Cinnamon and nutmeg. Pepper, red and white and black. Almond milk and onions. Cloves and lemongrass and precious saffron, and stranger spices, rarer still. The only light came from an iron brazier shaped like a basilisk\\'s head, a dim green light that made the walls of the tent look cold and dead and rotten. Had it been that way in life as well? Cersei could not seem to remember.*\\n\\n*The sorceress was sleeping in the dream, as once she\\'d slept in life. Leave her be, the queen wanted to cry out. You little fools, never wake a sleeping sorceress. Without a tongue, she could only watch as the girl threw off her cloak, kicked the witch\\'s bed, and said, \"Wake up, we want our futures told.\"* – A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nEnyo – horror – robed in saffron\\n\\n*The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense. Lady Sybell\\'s grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper, almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps. And the grandmother was some woman he\\'d brought back from the east. A frightening old crone, supposed to be a priestess. Maegi, they called her. No one could pronounce her real name. Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the like.\" He shrugged. \"She\\'s long dead, to be sure. And Jeyne seemed a sweet child, I\\'ll grant you, though I only saw her once. But with such doubtful blood . . .\"* -Storm of Swords, Tyrion III\\n\\nNot only does the Tent of Maggy the Frog smell of saffron and spices, but her descendent goes on to found house Spicer. Her eyes are yellow as the eyes of death, and she instills horror in others.\\n\\nAtropos – The Future – Inevitability – Cutter of threads - The Dead One – Morta\\n\\n*\"Some are here who have no futures,\" Maggy muttered in her terrible deep voice. She pulled her robe about her shoulders and beckoned the girls closer. \"Come, if you will not go. Fools. Come, yes. I must taste your blood.\"*\\n\\n*Melara paled, but not Cersei. A lioness does not fear a frog, no matter how old and ugly she might be. She should have gone, she should have listened, she should have run away. Instead she took the dagger Maggy offered her, and ran the twisted iron blade across the ball of her thumb. Then she did Melara too.* - A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nIn order to tell Cersei and the other girls how they will die, they must be cut and let her taste a drop of blood.\\n\\nMorta is responsible for the pain and/or death that occur in a half-wake, half-sleep time frame, and we get this vision through Cersei half remembering and half dreaming.\\n\\nNemain – seize/take/deal out (possibly related to the Greek, “Nemesis”) - frenzied havoc of war - bean nighe or “washerwoman”, an omen of death.\\n\\nIn the grand Irish epic of the Tain Bo Cuailnge, Neman confounds armies, so that friendly bands fall in mutual slaughter.\\n\\nMaggy causes/predicts that Cersei will kill her friend, pushing her down a well. And Maggy’s decedents cause the Red Wedding.\\n\\nMaggy also presents Cersei with “the Valonquar”, her nemesis, who is destined to destroy her.\\n\\n*The old woman\\'s eyes were yellow, and crusted all about with something vile. In Lannisport it was said that she had been young and beautiful when her husband had brought her back from the east with a load of spices, but age and evil had left their marks on her. She was short, squat, and warty, with pebbly greenish jowls. Her teeth were gone and her dugs hung down to her knees. You could smell sickness on her if you stood too close, and when she spoke her breath was strange and strong and foul.* - A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII\\n\\nNot only does she have no teeth, but some distinguishing characteristic of a bean nighe are being short and squat, small and green, and described as having unusually long breasts, or dugs. If caught they will reveal a man’s fate, or grant wishes... depending on the tale.\\n\\nSkuld – debt – future – a Valkyrie\\n\\nSkuld is the youngest of the Norns, as Maggy is the youngest of these three wise women of Westeros. She is both a Norn and a Valkyrie, not only “the one who cuts” or determines lives’ ends, but also marks significant changes, such as marriages and births… both of which are major parts of Maggy’s predictions to Cersei and company. Maggy’s decedents also bring about the Red Wedding, or a feast of the dead, which is what a Valkarie selected soldiers on the battlefield for, to feast in Odin’s Halls. Jeyne Westerling cared for Rob who was injured on the battlefield, before delivering him to the Red Wedding.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I thought it would be interesting to look at all of the major players and what they were up to that led us to where we begin in *A Game of Thrones*\\n\\n**A quick look at what the major players did right before the series started and what their goal/plan was moving forward**\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Brynden Rivers**\\n\\n- Disappeared on a Ranging\\n\\n&gt;Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC. \\n\\n- Possibly sent the mother direwolf south of the Wall \\n\\n&gt;\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. **His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind**.\\n\\n&gt;**\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\"** -AGOT, Bran I\\n\\nHis goals are pretty ambiguous at this point. We know he wanted to contact Bran/Jon and that he was at least involved in the return of the others.\\n\\n**Littlefinger/Lysa**\\n\\n&gt;\"If you were anyone else, I would banish you. Send you down to Lord Nestor at the Gates of the Moon, or back to the Fingers. How would you like to spend your life on that bleak shore, surrounded by slatterns and sheep pellets? That was what my father meant for Petyr. Everyone thought it was because of that stupid duel with Brandon Stark, but that wasn\\'t so. Father said I ought to thank the gods that so great a lord as Jon Arryn was willing to take me soiled, but I knew it was only for the swords. I had to marry Jon, or my father would have turned me out as he did his brother, but it was Petyr I was meant for. I am telling you all this so you will understand how much we love each other, how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another. We made a baby together, a precious little baby.\" Lysa put her hands flat against her belly, as if the child was still there. \"When they stole him from me, I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again. Jon wished to send my sweet Robert to Dragonstone, and that sot of a king would have given him to Cersei Lannister, but I never let them . . . no more than I\\'ll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger. Do you hear me, Alayne or Sansa or whatever you call yourself? Do you hear what I am telling you?\"  -ASOS, Sansa VII\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;Lady Lysa seemed pleased by that. \"I knew that boy Joffrey. He used to call my Robert cruel names, and once he slapped him with a wooden sword. **A man will tell you poison is dishonorable, but a woman\\'s honor is different. The Mother shaped us to protect our children, and our only dishonor is in failure**. You\\'ll know that, when you have a child.\" -ASOS, Sansa VI\\n\\nLysa seems to want to be with Petyr and the safety of her child/possible future children. \\n\\nPetyr wants to create as much chaos as possible between the great lords and use it to his advantage.\\n\\n**Jon Arryn**\\n\\n-Poisoned by Lysa but Pycelle/Cersei let him die\\n\\n&gt;When he felt the blood trickling down his neck and onto his chest, the old man shuddered, and the last strength went out of him. He looked shrunken, both smaller and frailer than he had been when they burst in on him. \"Yes,\" he whimpered, \"yes, Colemon was purging, so I sent him away. The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, she did not say so, could not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at her I knew. It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear it.\" The old man wept. \"Varys will tell you, it was the boy, his squire, Hugh he was called, he must surely have done it, ask your sister, ask her.\" -ACOK, Tyrion VI\\n\\n- Was investigating Robert\\'s bastards with Stannis\\n\\n&gt;\"I did,\" Ned told him, wondering. **What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king\\'s bastard, and why was it worth his life**? -AGOT, Eddard VI\\n\\nJon Arryn died trying to tell Robert that \"his seed was strong\".\\n\\n**Stannis Baratheon**\\n\\n- Fled King\\'s Landing after Jon Arryn\\'s death\\n\\n&gt;Stannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother\\'s name. He had given no word as to when he might return. \"Where did they go on these rides?\" Ned asked. -AGOT, Eddard VI\\n\\n- Began gathering swords, shadowbinders, etc.\\n\\n&gt;His father frowned. **\"I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai.** What does it mean? Is any of it true?\" He gave an irritated shrug. \"Kevan, bring us the map.\" -AGOT, Tyrion IX\\n\\nHis goal was to safely get away from King\\'s Landing and begin his preparation for a claim on the Iron Throne.\\n\\n**Cersei Lannister**\\n\\n- Allowed Jon Arryn to die\\n\\n- Tried to get Robert Arryn away from Lysa\\n\\n- Wanted Jaime as hand\\n\\n- Kill Robert/Remove Stannis/Renly as contenders for the throne\\n\\nCersei\\'s goals seem to keep her secret/children safe and remove potential contenders. She is also worried about Tyrion (valonqar) and a \"younger and more beautiful queen\".\\n\\n**Tywin Lannister**\\n\\nIt is hard to pinpoint just how involved with Robert\\'s death Tywin was, but we do know he was involved in the politics of King\\'s Landing.\\n\\n- He agreed to take Robert Arryn as a ward\\n\\n- Quotes such as this make it possible that he was involved in Robert\\'s death:\\n\\n&gt;You are the King\\'s Hand, and the king is a fool.\" The eunuch\\'s cloying tones were gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip. \"Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless … and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. **They** had hoped to kill him during the melee.\" -AGOT, Eddard VII\\n\\n- We know he hasn\\'t a big fan of Robert\\n\\n&gt;Lord Tywin stared at him as if he had lost his wits. \"You deserve that motley, then. We had come late to Robert\\'s cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever. And Robert\\'s relief was palpable.** As stupid as he was**, even he knew that Rhaegar\\'s children had to die if his throne was ever to be secure. Yet he saw himself as a hero, and heroes do not kill children.\" His father shrugged. \"I grant you, it was done too brutally. Elia need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she was nothing.\" -ASOS, Tyrion VI\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"Yes, I recall now,\" Cersei said, \"Robert often told Joff that a king must be bold.\"\\n\\n&gt;\"And what were you telling him, pray? I did not fight a war to seat Robert the Second on the Iron Throne. You gave me to understand the boy cared nothing for his father.\" -ASOS, Tyrion VI\\n\\nSo its hard to say, Tywin seemed like he did a good job of remaining blind to things that he didn\\'t want to see (Jaime still his heir and Jaime/Cersei). So while we don\\'t know for sure I think we can at least say that we know he was involved in the affairs of KL (even though he was at Casterly Rock) and was focused on increasing Lannister power/wealth (crown owes the Lannisters 3 million dragons, Lannisters as Robert\\'s squires/cupbearers, etc.) \\n\\n**Dorne**\\n\\nAfter Oberyn unsuccessfully tried to raise Dorne for Viserys after Robert\\'s Rebellion, there was later a secret marriage pact made for Viserys/Arianne which was witnessed by the Sealord of Braavos.\\n\\nDoran\\'s plan seemed to be an ever evolving plan that was a super long con to get revenge on Elia\\'s murders and possible increase Dornish power in KL.\\n\\nThe main reason for his apprehension and reluctance is that unlike the Golden Company, Dorne doesn\\'t have the option to \"retreat across the sea\".\\n\\n**Varys/Illyrio**\\n\\nDue to some retconning, etc. by GRRM, I don\\'t think Varys/Illyrio\\'s original plan can make complete sense no matter how you look at it.\\n\\nFrom the info we have available though their planned seemed to be to use Dany to get an army for Viserys, keep Robert alive long enough that war would break out right before Viserys\\' invasion (with the Dothraki and possibly the GC and an alliance with Dorne) which would allow for an invasion of a weakened, war torn Westeros. (Interesting to think about how Varys/Illyrio were technically screwing Dorne with this marriage pact).\\n\\nThis invasion was just to further the wreckage on Westeros who then would have fAegon sweep in on a white horse and save the day/possibly marry Dany. Obviously this plan has had to change numerous times.\\n\\n&gt;\"The gods alone know,\" the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. \"The fools tried to kill his son, and what\\'s worse, they made a mummer\\'s farce of it. He\\'s not a man to put that aside. **I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other\\'s throats, whether we will it or no.\"**\\n\\n\"Too soon, too soon,\" the voice with the accent complained.** \"What good is war now? We are not ready. Delay.\"** -AGOT, Arya III\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"Which plan?\" said Tristan Rivers. \"The fat man\\'s plan? The one that changes every time the moon turns? First Viserys Targaryen was to join us with fifty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. Then the Beggar King was dead, and it was to be the sister, a pliable young child queen who was on her way to Pentos with three new-hatched dragons. Instead the girl turns up on Slaver\\'s Bay and leaves a string of burning cities in her wake, and the fat man decides we should meet her by Volantis. Now that plan is in ruins as well. \\n\\n&gt;\"I have had enough of Illyrio\\'s plans. Robert Baratheon won the Iron Throne without the benefit of dragons. We can do the same. And if I am wrong and the realm does not rise for us, we can always retreat back across the narrow sea, as Bittersteel once did, and others after him.\" -ADWD, The Lost Lord\\n\\n***\\n\\nObviously it must be noted that with *A Game of Thrones* being so long ago some of the foreshadowing could have been changed, as we have seen with numerous plotlines (Jaime becoming king, possibly Tyrion burning Winterfell, etc.)\\n\\n**TLDR: What the major players were up to before the party started and what they wanted to do when they got there**.',\n",

It's been a while since I've read Fire and Blood but we know the Targaryens escaped the Doom of Valyria because of a prophetic dream, so it could be that a similar prophetic dream told them that in some far away time the true enemey will come from the North.\\n\\nSo what could Aegon do? Even if he told everyone he'd have only been regarded as mad without a proof, even if he passed down laws to prepare for the attack they'd be considered the ramblings of a mad man and be abolished by the time they were needed. So instead he prepared for the attack in the only way he could: he made sure that by the time the Others would come they wouldn't find seven kings quarreling between one another, but seven kingdoms united under one ruler to take them on.

He killed Jon Arryn, Stannis likely feared he would be next and knew he was the Rightful King so he fled to Dragonstone. Once Stannis is at Dragonstone everyone knows war between Stannis and The Lannisters is coming. \\n\\nLittlefinger and Renly seem to be friends on the Small Council. The first time Ned gets there he sees them speaking and Stannis says Renly would jest with Littlefinger on the Small Council. \\n\\nI think Littlefinger was playing him. He told Renly about the twincest (or maybe Renly already knew) and planted the idea in his head that he would be a better King than Stannis. Renly gobbled it up and pressed his claim once Robert died. \\n\\nAlso worth mentioning is Littlefinger makes an alliance with the Tyrells rather easily after Renly’s death. He may have already been in contact with them and offers a fallback once Renly dies. Olenna and Littlefinger also work together during the Purple Wedding.\\n\\nTL:DR\\nLittlefinger convinced Renly that he would make a better King than Stannis adding another King, more war, and more chaos in Westeros',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Arya as a sailor has been foreshadowed in the books, even though I, like many others here, was never convinced she would just leave her family towards the end of the world like that. That was the biggest flaw of that ending, and it has bothered me for a while. What Arya wants most in the world to go back home, to her family, and have her own loyal pack. Everything else is secondary. So why the hell would she just leave them when she got them back? \\n\\nBut the foreshadowing of her sailing is still there in-text and it’s bot going just because we don’t like it, it makes no sense for show Arya sure, but book Arya is a different character altogether. She has shown interest in it for a long time:\\n\\nIn A Game of Thrones:\\n\\n&gt; A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. **Maybe that was the way out.Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too.** - Arya V\\n\\nIn A Clash of Kings:\\n\\n&gt; “If I had wings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself. And if it was true, I’d just fly away, fly up past the moon and the shining stars, and **see all the things in Old Nan’s stories**, dragons and **sea monsters** and the Titan of Braavos, and maybe I wouldn’t ever fly back unless I wanted to.” - Arya X\\n\\nIn A Feast for Crows:\\n\\n&gt; Arya bit her lip. She had crossed the narrow sea to get here, but **if the captain had asked she would have told him she wanted to stay aboard the Titan\\'s Daughter**. Salty was too small to man an oar, she knew that now, but she could learn to splice ropes and reef the sails and **steer a course across the great salt seas**. Denyo had taken her up to the crow\\'s nest once, and she hadn\\'t been afraid at all, though the deck had seemed a tiny thing below her. I can do sums too, and keep a cabin neat. - Arya I\\n\\nWhen taking her first FM disguise as Cat, her first thought for her backstory was to be from White Harbor, but decided not to, because she didn’t know it as well.\\n\\n&gt; \"King\\'s Landing.\" She had visited White Harbor with her father twice, but she knew King\\'s Landing better. - Arya II\\n\\nShe thought White Harbor at first because Cat is a romanticized Arya. I mean, she even made her fictional parents so in love with each other, a bravo killed her father when he said his wife (Cat’s mother) was even more beautiful than the courtesans. We know that she was hurt of the idea her father might have loved another woman (Ashara Dayne) and that her mother was previously betrothed to her uncle Brandon Stark, so they didn’t marry out of love. Even with Gendry pointing out that she has a bastard brother, of course it was possible he loved another once. But she was hurt. \\n\\nThat’s how Cat is an idealized Arya. She wanted to idealize her even more by making her originate from a port city she had enjoyed visiting before, but King’s Landing would do too, even if she hated it because at least King’s Landing is a coastal city too. \\n\\n&gt; Only Braavosi were permitted use of the Purple Harbor, from the Drowned Town and the Sealord\\'s Palace; ships from her sister cities and the rest of the wide world had to use the Ragman\\'s Harbor, a poorer, rougher, dirtier port than the Purple. It was noisier as well, as sailors and traders from half a hundred lands crowded its wharves and alleys, mingling with those who served and preyed on them. **Cat liked it best of any place in Braavos. She liked the noise and the strange smells, and seeing what ships had come in on the evening tide and what ships had departed. She liked the sailors too; the boisterous Tyroshi with their booming voices and dyed whiskers; the fair-haired Lyseni, always trying to niggle down her prices; the squat, hairy sailors from the Port of Ibben, growling curses in low, raspy voices.** Her favorites were the Summer Islanders, with their skins as smooth and dark as teak. They wore feathered cloaks of red and green and yellow, and the tall masts and white sails of their swan ships were magnificent. - Cat of the Canals\\n\\nCat is unlike other identities that Arya has taken, because she actually likes being Cat, and a large part of it is the lifestyle associated with the sea:\\n\\n&gt; She missed the friends she’d had when she was Cat of the Canals; Old Brusco with his bad back, his daughters Talea and Brea, the mummers from the Ship, Merry and her whores at the Happy Port, all the other rogues and wharfside scum. She missed Cat herself the most of all, even more than she missed her eyes. She had liked being Cat, more than she had ever liked being Salty or Squab or Weasel or Arry. I killed Cat when I killed that singer. - The Blind Girl\\n\\nIn The Winds of Winter:\\n\\n&gt; **Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above**, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin. - Mercy\\n\\nNot to mention her water motif, or the fact she names her direwolf for a notorious sailor queen. Guys, it has been established that she loves the sea. And she has loved it for a long time. Sailing is something she has wanted to do all her life. It’s perfectly in line with her character to end her arc sailing.\\n\\nThe problem is abandoning her family for adventure. That’s not in line with Arya. But why else would she want to go Westwards other than adventure? What else can be there that she might want? My epiphany? Money to rebuild Westeros. \\n\\nOk, here me out. Westeros has been pretty devastated from wars already, and with winter coming, things will become worse. Westeros imports from Essos the things they need, but the parts of Essos they trade with have been so far destroyed by Dany. Their economies are in shambles. Slave trade is extremely lucrative to them, but Dany is hell bent to abolish and she has three dragons too. Maybe they’ll borrow money from the Iron Bank of Braavos, but how will they pay them back? Finding new trade routes to rebuild their destroyed economy is a possibility. But who the hell has the balls and desire to undertake such a risky mission? Arya. This is truly a risky mission, but it’s both adventure and duty to her. She has a reason to support King Bran’s reconstruction policies, he is her brother. And he will need money.\\n\\nNow, I know there are still issues people have with the ending, such as what about the crew, what about experience, but I tackled this from a character motivation perspective, not skill-based one, because that’s the most difficult part to accept for her character. She loves her family more than anything, abandoning them is extremely odd for her. As for the skills, she is still young, she can still learn those skills. That ending will come immediately after Bran is crowned, it might take a few years before she truly leaves.',\n",

Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. *(6)* A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. *(7)* A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. *(8)* . . . mother of dragons, bride of fire . . .\\n\\n1: Rhaego? Had he lived, maybe he would have burned KL.\\n2: Rhaegar dying in the trident.\\n3: Stannis.\\n4: Young Griff.\\n5: Some people think this is a dragon from DrangonStone, others think this is Jon Connington because the Grey Scale.\\n6: I don't know what this mean.\\n7: I don't know that this mean too, I think this is Jon Connington. The dead man with grey lips because the grey scale.\\n8: This one I don't know.\\n\\nSo what do you think 6, 7 and 8 mean?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'In this post I would like to throw out the unlikely idea that:\\n\\n**Aerion Brightflame\\'s son Maegor was the Smiling Knight.**\\n\\n***\\n\\n#The Smiling Knight\\n\\n&gt;We all do. \"When I was a squire I told myself I\\'d be the man to slay the Smiling Knight.\"\\n\\n&gt;\"The Smiling Knight?\" She sounded lost. \"Who was that?\" \\n\\n&gt;**The Mountain of my boyhood. Half as big but twice as mad**. -AFFC, Jaime IV\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;And he\\'d held his own against the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser Arthur who slew him. What a fight that was, and what a foe. **The Smiling Knight was a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up together, but he did not know the meaning of fear.** And Dayne, with Dawn in hand . . . The outlaw\\'s longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one. \"It\\'s that white sword of yours I want,\" the robber knight told him as they resumed, though he was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then. \"Then you shall have it, ser,\" the Sword of the Morning replied, and made an end of it. -ASOS, Jaime VIII\\n\\n***\\n\\n#Maegor Targaryen\\n\\nAerion would have been a perfect match, but would have been around 90 years old if he hadn\\'t decided to sip on some wildfire. His son Maegor was born in 232 AC and therefore would have been about 49 when he died in 281 AC.\\n\\nHe disappears from the story after he loses the Great Council of 233. But if he had his father\\'s nature, as many thought he did then it could be a possible match:\\n\\n&gt;The chief issue of Maekar\\'s reign was the question of his heirs. He had a number of sons and daughters, but there were those who had reason to doubt their fitness to rule. The eldest, Prince Daeron, was known as the Drunken, and preferred to be styled Prince of Summerhall because he found Dragonstone such a gloomy abode. **Next after him was Prince Aerion, known as Brightflame or Brightfire—a most puissant knight but cruel and capricious, and a dabbler in the black arts**. Both of these princes died before their father, though both had issue. Prince Daeron sired a daughter, Vaella, in 222 AC, but the girl sadly proved simple. **Aerion Brightfire\\'s son was born in 232 AC, and given the ominous name of Maegor by his sire**, but the Bright Prince himself died that same year when he drank a cup of wildfire in the belief that it would allow him to transform himself into a dragon. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Maekar I\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;In 233 AC, hundred of lords great and small assembled in King\\'s Landing. With both of Maekar\\'s elder sons deceased, there were four possible claimants. The Great Council dismissed Prince Daeron\\'s sweet but simple-minded daughter Vaella immediately. Only a few spoke up for Aerion Brightflame\\'s son Maegor; an infant king would have meant a long, contentious regency, and there were also fears that the boy might have inherited his father\\'s cruelty and madness**. -TWOIAF, The Targaryen Kings: Maekar I\\n\\nand if Maekar is like Aerion at all:\\n\\n&gt;\"Is there any doubt of it? If Prince Maekar had been here, it would have gone differently, I promise you. **Aerion is all smiles and chivalry** so long as his father is watching, if the tales be true, but when he\\'s not . . - The Hedge Knight\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;**He is mad, thought Dunk, but he is still a prince\\'s son**, and he means to kill me. He might have prayed then, if he had known a prayer all the way through, but there was no time. **There was hardly even time to be afraid**. -The Hedge Knight\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"You are too kind, sweet brother,\" said Prince Aerion, **all smiles**, \"but it would be selfish of me to deny you the right to prove the truth of your words at the hazard of your body. I must insist upon a trial of seven.\"  -The Hedge Knight\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;The Second Blackfyre Rebellion proved a debacle, but that was not always to be the case. In 219 AC, Haegon Blackfyre and Bittersteel launched the Third Blackfyre Rebellion. Of the deeds done then, both good and ill—of the leadership of Maekar, **the actions of Aerion Brightflame**, the courage of Maekar\\'s youngest son, and the second duel between Bloodraven and Bittersteel—we know well. The pretender Haegon I Blackfyre died in the aftermath of battle, slain treacherously after he had given up his sword, but Ser Aegor Rivers, Bittersteel, was taken alive and returned to the Red Keep in chains. Many still insist that if he had been put to the sword then and there, as Prince Aerion and Bloodraven urged, it might have meant an early end to the Blackfyre ambitions. -TWOIAF: The Targaryen Kings: Aerys I\\n\\n***\\n\\nIs it possible that Maegor is the Smiling Knight? Yes, but we have nowhere near enough info to make any solid connections outside of the similarities between the smiling knight/Aerion and the timeline.\\n\\nLet me know what you think and if you have anything to add or that can discount this.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that we have seen members of wealthy houses become outlaws:\\n\\n&gt;Aenys\\'s son, **AEGON BLOODBORN, an outlaw**, -ACOK, Appendix\\n\\n**TLDR: There is a possibility that Aerion Brightflame\\'s son Maegor became the Smiling Knight**',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I was listening to an audiobook of the original Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and I couldn\\'t help but see the parallels between it and Cersei in AFFC.  In the Cersei chapters of AFFC Cersei is trying to find out who the most beautiful queen is, and make it herself, so she can avoid the Maegi the Frog Prophecy. Just like the mean queen is trying to be the most beautiful in the land.  Cersi might as well be saying \"Looking Glass, Looking Glass on the wall, who is the fairest queen of them all.\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOf course if we have an evil Queen we need a snow white.  I don\\'t see one yet, but there are some important parallels in the rest of the fable.  Of course Snow White has seven Dwarfs.  And there are traditionally seven kingsguard members (or Queensguard).  Snow White does of course bring up the white imagery, the kingsguard cloaks are white, Dany\\'s hair is mostly white.  Dany will soon be traveling with two dwarfs (Tyrion and Penny).  So, I am seeing some parallels between Snow White and Dany.  Cersei herself has killed many dwarfs that people have tried to pass off as Tyrion, has there been seven?  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, just your most random comparison, there may not be anything to it.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"At least for me, all three are quite even although I favor Aegon III just because of how the realm was split. But here is the case for each and every one of them.\\n\\nJaehaerys I: I would put him at #2. He fixed the war with The Faith. He made the doctrine of exceptionalism. He fixed the mistakes Maegor made.  Aegon conquered the realm, but Jaehaerys made the realm whole\\n\\nDaeron II: I put him at #3. Not for lack of a challenge. There would be 4 rebellions after this. He won the war and helped sow it back up afterward without dragons. He certainly did have a challenge, but not as big as the others\\n\\nAegon III: Now I put him at #1. Some people could chalk up the credit to Tyland or Viserys II, and while they do get some credit, Aegon III was King and did rule. After the Dance, even for decades afterward, I view the realm as a tinderbox. One little spark and it could all burn up. The Dance truly spilt the realm in two. The Crownlands were split in two in who they were fighting for. The West and Reach and Stormlands fought for Aegon II and The Rest for Rhaenyra. The realm itself was truly split. So wrong step and it all falls apart. Even decades after the dance. Aegon III and Viserys II ruled together during Aegon III's rule. So whether you credit both of them or just one, Aegon III still had the harder challenge of healing the realm.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '(I posted this yesterday but it got removed for apparent spoilers in the title)\\n\\nI know the show has been discussed to death and all of our qualms with it have been well and truly expressed. However, something occurred to me the other day that, while it wouldn\\'t fix a lot, would definitely have made things a bit more logical and palatable.\\n\\nDelaying executing Littlefinger.\\n\\nA lot has been made and rightly so of how ridiculous Littlefinger\\'s \"trial\" and execution were. While the Starks know of his crimes because they believe Bran, pretty much everyone else is just taking their word for it and they summarily cut the throat of the Vale\\'s Regent.\\n\\nThe ridiculousness of this and everything leading up to it aside, D&amp;D were trying to wrap character arcs up and the quickest way to do that is killing them, right? But Petyr Baelish could have made the following season make so much more sense.\\n\\nA lot has been made about how the political machinations don\\'t really make any sense since everybody is essentially on the same side in the North from the get go of season 8. Sansa\\'s completely illogical dislike of Dany despite her coming to literally save them and being capable of burning them all to death if she wanted makes far more sense with someone that we know as a political agitator whispering in her ear. Sansa\\'s actions despite being the \"smartest person\" Arya knows are those of an imbecile. It would be logical that the \"master manipulator\" that Littlefinger is would be playing these two characters against each other especially if he had another goal in mind. One with dragons.\\n\\nHow much more sense would Dany\\'s arc into madness have made if she had someone with ill intent telling her the whole time that others are plotting against her? As it played out, she went crazy all on her own just because. The paranoia came out of freaking nowhere and there was absolutely no one stoking those embers, all just her being insecure about not being elected Prom Queen after The Long Night. Having been rejected by Sansa, Baelish now hitches his cart to another horse, one that\\'s a foreigner to Westeros with little love from the common people that Baelish manages to ingratiate himself with.\\n\\nThis also makes Varys\\' death make way more sense. You don\\'t even need to write in Varys\\' plotting against Dany at all, he can remain loyal to the end, he\\'s been Baelish\\'s biggest rival since the beginning and we could see Petyr finally managing to cleanse the earth of Varys on a bullshit charge. If Littlefinger found out about Jon\\'s lineage, he\\'d be the one to weaponize it but not as a means of putting Jon on the throne, as a means of getting rid of his rivals by framing them as traitors.\\n\\nThere\\'s so much that could have been done with Baelish in the final season to polish the turd. Hell, you could explain how Bronn got past the guards at Winterfell and found Jaime and Tyrion. In fact, him trying to play both sides would make the most sense. Feeding both sides misinformation about each other\\'s intents.\\n\\nYou could explain many, many characters\\' incredibly stupid decisions by having someone who is actively working against their interests being one of their chief advisers.\\n\\nThen it can all go the same way, with Sansa executing Littlefinger before we actually get to King\\'s Landing, but for crimes we get to see her reveal and an actual trial before the end. Also, the one who passes the sentence should swing the sword but that\\'s small fries in the grand scheme.\\n\\nAnyway, just some thoughts on a slow Tuesday work day. I know it most certainly doesn\\'t fix anything but it would have at least vacuumed the carpets of the Titanic as it was going down.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '(Spoilers Published) Broken Masts, Broken Men: Stannis and the Windproud\\n\\n&gt; The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its name. The lord\\'s two-masted galley *Windproud* broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father\\'s ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm\\'s End. -**A Clash of Kings**, *Prologue*\\n\\nMuch has been made of Stannis Baratheon\\'s personality by ASOIAF readers. Sour if you\\'re feeling charitable, asshole if you\\'re not. And that\\'s even before he grants Melisandre a place at court, takes part in his brother\\'s assassination (knowingly or otherwise), and starts to burn people alive. \\n\\nAnd while great work has been done on Stannis as an adult (a favorite of mine being BryndenBFish\\'s [Iron Bends](https://warsandpoliticsoficeandfire.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/iron-bends-the-surprising-flexibility-of-stannis-baratheon/), and any of Steven Attewell\\'s analysis of the middle Baratheon) I think that there\\'s more to be said on Stannis\\' origins and the important events that put him on the path to the event that cements his reputation in Westeros, the siege of Storm\\'s End. \\n\\nSo how does Stannis get to the point that he’d eat rats and boot leather rather than surrender his ancestral home on behalf of a brother who he did not love nor loved him in turn? Because of the crack of the *Windproud’s* mast and the death of his parents in Shipbreaker Bay. The *Windproud* is *the* event that put Stannis on that path. \\n\\nHow do we know this? For that, we turn to my favorite quote in ASOIAF: \\n\\n&gt;“I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the *Windproud* break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed. In King\\'s Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.”\\n\\nThis is, I\\'d argue, *the* single most important lens through which to view Stannis from then on. I posted this in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/em017v/spoilers_main_whats_everyones_favourite/fdm7taj/) about underrated/unknown quotes. I threw out the shell of my thinking on that quote* and if you want the tl;dr version, you can find it there. \\n\\nIn this longer version, I\\'ll look at three different facets of the sinking of the \\n*Windproud* and its aftermath: the issue of trauma within ASOIAF, the impact on the relationship between Stannis and Robert, and ultimately how Stannis reacts to his parents\\' deaths by trying to make sense of the world. \\n\\nMuch of this analysis has appeared on both the Planetos Podcast ([episode 17](https://soundcloud.com/planetos-podcast/episode-17-stannis-at-the-gates-with-frank-bumb) and 18) and the [NotACast Podcast, ACoK, Davos I, Part 2](https://notacastasoiaf.podbean.com/e/episode-83-a-clash-of-kings-davos-i-the-stuff-of-heroes-part-2-ft-frank-b/), with refinements and tweaks each time. This post is my effort to put that analysis in writing for the subreddit after some kind encouragement in the underrated/unknown thread. I encourage y\\'all to check out both podcasts even outside of this analysis! \\n\\n#Trauma\\n\\nGeorge R.R. Martin likes writing about trauma. Or, if he doesn\\'t enjoy it, he writes about it profusely. From Ned\\'s fever dreams of the duel at the Tower of Joy and Lyanna\\'s bed of blood, Aeron\\'s rusted iron hinge, and all of Theon in *Dance*, Martin has shown himself to be remarkably multi-faceted in how his characters process their respective traumas. Ned refuses to foster any of his children, Aeron literally drowns himself in his faith and Theon... Reek Reek, it doesn\\'t rhyme with dissociative coping mechanisms. \\n\\nHaving your parents drown would be traumatic no matter the circumstances. But having to *watch* as their ship sank after getting to within sight of you and their home after a months-long trip in Essos? That puts this event into the sort of traumatic events that are more often discussed among the fandom. But it\\'s rare that the *Windproud* is discussed in the same vein as those events mentioned above. And for good reason! It\\'s only four lines in the *Clash* paperback. One of the rare times Stannis bears his soul to anyone, and it\\'s to the one person he respects: Davos Seaworth. \\n\\nThat\\'s because Stannis has papered over this trauma and buried it deep beneath an exterior of an *iron*  man, one who is \"strong, able and just.\" I’m sure all of us either know or have been the kind of person who has faced a traumatic situation and thrown themselves into their work rather than face it. For just one example of this from Stannis: \\n\\n&gt; \"House Florent can field two thousand swords at best.\" It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms. -**A Clash of Kings**, *Prologue*\\n\\nThink how long it would take you, reader, with every single ASOIAF book and the internet at your fingertips to figure out the strength of every house in Westeros. Stannis has done it in a largely illiterate society using BIRDS. Because if he focuses on figuring out just how many troops some dune prince in Dorne has, well, then maybe he won’t hear the snap of a wooden mast in the churning sea that has become his memory, threatening to drag him down at any moment. \\n\\nThe mast of the *Windproud* is to Stannis what the rusted iron hinge is to Aeron. Fitting, in that Stannis’ flagship Fury destroys Aeron’s Golden Storm at the Battle of Fair Isle and begins Aeron on the path to becoming the Damphair. Aeron uses religion to drown, almost literally, his trauma at the hands of Euron. Stannis drowns the trauma of his parents’ deaths in his work, his role as the dutiful younger brother to Robert, and his rejection of the Seven. \\n\\nTo crib from another great podcast, *Girls Gone Canon*, they talk about how Robert and Ned never really dealt with their trauma from Robert\\'s Rebellion, they\\'re \"frozen in time\" to quote GGC. Specifically, Robert is frozen as an exuberant, irresponsible but gregarious frat-boy jock. Stannis, in turn, is stuck in time as a moody goth, never given the chance to laugh by Patchface or his parents. \\n\\n#Robert and Stannis\\n\\nSo, really, how well could a moody goth get along with *Robert* of all people? Turns out... great! Ned does just fine. And that relationship compared to Stannis could be that Ned is just *better*, more friendly than Stannis. Or maybe it\\'s something as simple as what you hate in your family, you like in your friends. But I think there\\'s something more here, namely the *Windproud* again.\\n\\nSpecifically, Robert associates *his* trauma from the *Windproud* with Stannis. That\\'s why this essay is Broken Men, and not just man. This is not explicit so feel free to hit me on this because it is a supposition (Robert doesn\\'t speak of the *Windproud*. Which may just be him burying his feelings on it or GRRM just not having thought of the *Windproud* at that point). \\n\\nDespite being a supposition, there\\'s compelling circumstantial evidence for viewing how Robert likely reacted to the *Windproud*. What do we know about Robert? \\n\\n&gt; \"Rocks and trees and rivers, that\\'s what your realm is made of,\" the Hound was saying. \"Do the rocks need defending? Robert wouldn\\'t have thought so. **If he couldn\\'t fuck it, fight it, or drink it, it bored him** -Sandor Clegane, **A Storm of Swords**, *Arya VI*\\n\\nThat\\'s a sentiment shared for pretty much everyone who knew Robert. Even his best friend, Ned, recognized that Robert closed his eyes to things he couldn\\'t solve with his warhammer or his dick. \\n\\nSo how do we think Robert would handle internal trauma from his teenage years? He\\'d bury it. But Stannis, much the same way that Jon Snow is a \"walking talking reminder\" of Ned\\'s supposed infidelity to Catelyn, is a walking, talking reminder of their time up on the parapets. The difference being that while Catelyn could not escape Jon, Robert could escape Stannis:\\n\\n&gt; The same was true of Robert, who divided his time between Storm\\'s End and the Vale after reaching manhood, -GRRM, **So Spake Martin**, *March 16, 2000*\\n\\nI think it\\'s a reasonable inference to draw that the *Windproud* further poisoned an already fraught relationship between the two Baratheon brothers. \\n\\nThe other detriment to their relationship is that Robert becomes both Stannis\\' paternal and fraternal figure: The head of the household as well as his older brother. Worse, there\\'s nobody *above* Robert who can\\'t reach down to Stannis. Steffon and Cassana aren\\'t there to tell Stannis \"Hey, it\\'s fine your Goshawk isn\\'t soaring, it\\'s an ambush predator anyway.\" There\\'s no chance for a \"which one of you was a marksman at 10?\" moment for Stannis, let alone to force them to get along better, ala Arya and Sansa. \\n\\nYou combine all of that with the loss itself and Stannis is hollowed out in his teenage years by this experience and the aftermath of Robert’s indifference and callousness. So much so that it shapes Stannis’ entire worldview, reaching for a sort of secular fanaticism every bit as fervent as Aeron clutching to the Drowned God and the Old Way. \\n\\n#Justice from Duty\\n\\nThe world view Stannis crafts is one of not merely *justice* but a conception of justice revolving around *duty*. Does he always meet these lofty ideals? Of course not; few people always hit their aspirational principles. Pride and envy, as other commentators have pointed out, can and do prevent him from reaching for those ideals. But those ideals are still what he strives for.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth repeating these lines here: \\n\\n&gt; “I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the *Windproud* break up across the bay. Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship, I vowed.”\\n\\nMany have taken this line, and other expressions from Stannis, as an indication that Stannis is an atheist. And that’s a fair inference to draw. Regardless of what term we apply to his belief structure, his initial skepticism of religion is relevant for how he views Melisandre and how Melisandre has to work on him to move him toward his Nissa Nissa moment and fully become the Azor Ahai she believes him to be. (Mel\\'s obfuscation and clear set of steps she lays out for Stannis would be worth its own essay). \\n\\nBut I don\\'t think he\\'s an atheist. Note he uses the word “ANY” not \\'there could NOT POSSIBLY BE gods so monstrous…\\' He says “ANY gods so monstrous.” So the gods might exist, but they’re dicks! And what do we know about Stannis\\' disdain for the noble class? Part of it is that they kiss up to Robert and Renly\\'s false flatteries instead of just doing their goddamn jobs:\\n\\n&gt; \"Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer them pure cold water and they squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes.\" - Stannis Baratheon, **A Clash of Kings**, *Davos I*\\n\\nWell what\\'s the job of the gods? The job of any sovereign, in Stannis\\' mind: Justice!\\n\\n&gt; “In King\\'s Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.\" -Stannis Baratheon, **A Clash of Kings**, *Davos I*.\\n\\nDrowning his mother and father in front of him and his elder brother? That is *not just*. And so the gods are bad at their jobs. And if they\\'re bad at their jobs, they\\'ve failed in their duty as deities and therefore Stannis owes them no duty, let alone worship. \\n\\nBecause for Stannis, justice flows from interlocking relationships of duty. It’s almost the platonic ideal, the version of feudalism we got in textbooks but didn’t much happen in real life where said relationships flow both ways. So if the gods do not create justice, then it\\'s on men to create justice. And thus it’s my job, Stannis says, as younger brother, as Master of Ships, as Lord of Dragonstone then as KING to make justice. \\n\\nIt’s almost Batman-esque. Crime Alley is Shipbreaker Bay, where our character had to watch, helpless, as their parents died. Which leads to a broody goth aesthetic: Dragonstone is a gloomy batcave. Cressen is his Alfred. Davos (and then Jon) become his respective Robins (with Jon getting Jason Todded at the end of *Dance*, with a probable Red Hood-esque violent return). \\n\\nAnd then there comes the key facet, the connective tissue between these two characters: the injustice of their youth leading to the adult obsession with justice. And not only justice as an abstract concept but of them using their elevated positions in life to force an unjust world to become just. All of it in order to make sense of the trauma they can’t otherwise process. This line from arguably the best Batman comic, *The Dark Knight Returns*, ...Could easily come from Stannis.:\\n\\n&gt; “My parents taught me a different lesson... lying on this street... shaking in deep shock... dying for no reason at all. They showed me that the world only makes sense when you force it to.”\\n\\nAnd Stannis is going to FORCE the world to make sense, damnit. If Superman is a God pretending to be a man, and Batman is a man pretending to be a god… guess where Stannis fits?\\n\\nThis is important because Stannis believes so firmly not only justice founded in duty but *reciprocal* duty. He becomes one of the few lords, along with Daenerys^1, Eddard^2, and poor, damn Edmure^3, to view Westerosi feudalism as something more than an exploitative racket. So many nobles in Westeros view law and duty as something that protects them but does not bind them, and binds the smallfolk but does not protect them, as we see during the War of the Five Kings. \\n\\nNow obviously, as a King, and even before that, a son of a Lord paramount and then brother to the King, Stannis benefits and is protected by Westerosi feudalism. \\n\\nBut he is one of the few nobles, again, who believes that the law protects non-nobles. And that protection comes, in part, by the law binding him as a noble. We see this illustrated perhaps nowhere better than in Stannis\\' rejection of Axell Florent\\'s Claw Isle plan (in A Storm of Swords, Davos IV) which is really worth looking at in greater detail:\\n\\n&gt; \"I shall bring justice to Westeros.\" \\n\\nWell, don\\'t need to look into *this* in greater detail.\\n\\n&gt; “A thing Ser Axell understands as little as he does war.” \\n\\nAgain, the utter disdain for the nobles *as a class* not just because they’re bad at their jobs but because of how they *conceive* of their jobs. Axell’s plan from a purely tactical (but not strategic) sense is workable. It’ll provide gold and “glory” for a floundering campaign. But even if it’s a workable plan, Stannis is contemptuous of it because of how utterly devoid of duty it is toward the smallfolk. \\n\\n&gt; “Claw Isle would gain me naught . . . and it was evil, just as you said.” \\n\\nIt is the end of this sentence that truly makes this Stannis\\' finest hour, perhaps even more so than sailing North to defeat the wildlings. It\\'s not just that Axell\\'s plan was shit because it wouldn\\'t do anything for his cause strategically, Stannis rejects it even if would have gained him a boon! Because it was *evil*. And why was it evil?\\n\\n&gt; “Celtigar must pay the traitor\\'s price himself, in his own person.”\\n\\nBecause of the notions of duty are *individualized* for Stannis. And this shows that Stannis conceives of the peasantry as people with agency and value. He\\'s not a small-d democrat... but remember Stannis\\' letter declaring himself King because of the crime committed by the Lannisters? He doesn\\'t just send it to the nobles, but has it read in ports, fishing villages, outside taverns, etc. \\n\\nBecause he is King of *everyone*, even the smallfolk. And those people, like Davos, are capable of doing their *duty* and thus are owed, in turn, justice by their sovereign. \\n\\n&gt; “And when I come into my kingdom, he shall. Every man shall reap what he has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat.” \\n\\nAgain, the individualized nature of duty leading to individualized justice. Just as this means lifting up capable people like Davos it means punishing the corruption within the halls of power. Littlefinger, Varys, both the Lannisters and Tyrells, all of the scheming in book one and a fair bit of it afterwards is predicated on Stannis must not be King. And it’s not just because he’s a jerk, it’s because he’s a jerk who *knows* what they’re up to and wants to end it. Stannis wants to close the brothels because he’s a prude? Probably. But maybe it’s also meant to deal with a key facet of the power base for Littlefinger? \\n\\n&gt; “And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers, I promise you. They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that.”\\n\\nIf there\\'s one aspect of Stannis sense of justice it\\'s his focus on punishment. But we still see him engage in mercy in less-than-ideal circumstances when he needs to gain something (pardoning Renly\\'s lords) and circumstances where he has little to nothing to gain (not hanging Asha\\'s Ironborn as he told Jon he intended to). But here, it very much fits his conceptions of justice. \\n\\nHe also sees not just the protections and benefits of Westerosi feudalism but the obligations and acts upon those obligations. Davos is an expression of that. Davos is able to pull Stannis back from the abyss of embracing his Tywin-esque impulses (the poster boy for the Westerosi system protecting but not binding nobles) and not sacrifice, for the moment, Edric Storm by appealing to that sense of duty.\\n\\n“I know that a king protects his people, or he is no king at all,” Davos tells Stannis in Davos VI, A Storm of Swords. That is LAW. That’s a king’s PRIMARY duty. And Davos invokes it to save himself, the Night’s Watch, arguably the realm and, for the moment, Stannis himself.\\n\\n#Meta and Implications\\n\\nSo what should we take away from this notion of duty and justice and Stannis worldview? I think for that we have to go to the meta side just a bit. \\n\\nMartin, with ASOIAF,  is not just critiquing and responding to fantasy as a genre. He’s also critiquing and speaking *directly* to fantasy readers. Obviously Sansa is a species of that, she’s the stand-in for the naive fantasy genre and fantasy readers. But we see Martin doing this when he shows us the opposite side of the coin from what we, in a general sense, say we want from these kinds of novels. \\n\\nWe SAY we want Theon to suffer for his role in bringing down the Starks, well… okay, let’s see what that looks like? We SAY we want Dany to enact terrible vengeance on the slavers. We got a taste of that in Meereen with the crucifixions, the meal is still to come with fire and blood across Essos. \\n\\nWith Stannis, we SAY we want rulers who view their DUTY as putting the good of their subjects, of putting justice above themselves and with no nepotistic exceptions for their family. \\n\\nAnd Stannis does that in sailing north. That is his *duty*, just as Davos put it, to protect his people. But what happens when the threat is not the Wildlings \"100,000 strong\" but with really only a couple thousand actual fighters... What happens when it\\'s Others and the Army of the Dead? \\n\\nA King protects his people or he is no true King. If Stannis cannot protect his people, he is not King. And he *is* King, as [Martin himself calls him.](https://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html)\\n\\nStannis best and worst-selves are not just wrapped up within him but they both flow from the same place. It’s duty and justice that has Stannis as an opposition to corruption that has such disparate factions as the Lannisters, Tyrells, Littlefinger and Varys all actively plotting, sometimes separate, sometimes even together to keep him off the throne. It’s duty and justice that has Stannis sail North to protect **all** of *his* Seven Kingdoms, even parts that have not explicitly pledged him fealty. It’s duty and justice to protect ALL of humanity that lets the Wildlings through the wall. But it’s his conceptions of duty and justice that have him contemplate sacrificing Edric Storm. And it’s duty and justice that will see him embrace the most horrific possible action to stem the tide against the Others. All to protect his Kingdom, because that is a King’s duty. \\n\\nIn *Winds*, it is my belief that Stannis\\' very same notion of duty for even Gods and Kings, regardless of personal desires, means that this king is going to do a horrific act and sacrifice Shireen *to protect his people*, to fulfill his role as king and deliver them justice and protection from the Long Night. I need not recite the various foreshadowing for Shireen’s end as that has been done elsewhere. What I’m arguing is that, thematically, Stannis’ conception of justice and duty, flowing from the trauma of the *Windproud*,  are what’s going to lead him down the long path from his heart-on-fire banners to Shireen’s pyre.\\n\\nThe same impulse of duty that led Stannis to raise Davos up, to reject Claw Isle, to sail North to defend the Wall, to return \"Arya\" to Jon, is going to lead Stannis to sacrifice Shireen to gain the power Melisandre tells him is needed to stem the tide of darkness coming for *his* kingdom and *his* people. If he doesn\\'t? How is he any different than the gods who let the *Windproud* break up in Shipbreaker Bay?\\n\\nHe can get out of sacrificing Edric Storm because he still has options. But when the Others come, the cold winds rise and the mist that’s like a knife in your chest hits, all of those options will freeze. And when there’s no other way he’ll do what Aemon said the one man in 10,000 would do: He’ll show us what Varys, in turn, described as the terror of a truly just man and try to save the realm at the cost of Shireen. And there’s Martin, standing next to the ashes, asking us if we like what we see?\\n\\nAnd all of it flows from a boy witnessing the most traumatic of injustices trying to force the world to become just and make it just through duty. But duty won\\'t save Stannis, or Shireen. Because the shattered timbers of the *Windproud* are the kindling for the pyre on which they will burn. \\n\\n–--\\n\\n^1 &gt; “Why do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can\\'t protect themselves?” -Daenerys Targaryen, **A Storm of Swords**, *Daenerys III*\\n\\n^2 &gt; Back at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time.

The entire ADWD plotline in the North with Jon and Stannis is just so good.\\n\\n\\n&gt; Lord Pea Pod. If you were a man, I would kill you for that, but my sword is made of too fine a steel to besmirch with craven's blood. Aye, men are dying. More will die before we see Winterfell. What of it? This is war. Men die in war. That is as it should be. As it has always been.\\n\\n&gt; I want to live forever in a land where summer lasts a thousand years. I want a castle in the clouds where I can look down over the world. I want to be six-and-twenty again. When I was six-and-twenty I could fight all day and fuck all night. What men want does not matter. Winter is almost upon us, boy. And winter is death. I would sooner my men die fighting for the Ned's little girl than alone and hungry in the snow, weeping tears that freeze upon their cheeks. No one sings songs of men who die like that. As for me, I am old. This will be my last winter. Let me bathe in Bolton blood before I die. I want to feel it spatter across my face when my axe bites deep into a Bolton skull. I want to lick it off my lips and die with the taste of it on my tongue.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The show ending basically put Bran on the throne because GRRM told them it would be so. Here I propose a theory that Bran will be King, but not as Bran.  In the war for the dawn, the Children of the Forest fought against Man because they felt that Man was destroying their world. Cutting down the Weirwoods and such. Later, Children and Men fought together against the Others, and won. However, the Children did not necessarily win anything other than their existence, and a meager one at that.  I think the second war for the dawn will end in a pact as many believe. But the pact will involve introducing a kind of rule that keeps all parties happy, including the Children. Hence, someone who hails from both the Children and Men would be an ideal choice to ensure preservation and better future for all of Westeros. Who better to lead the realm into prosperity than the one person who unites Men, and Children of the Forest, and coincidentally carries all the info the realm has ever had? No repeated mistakes, better governance, and better climate.  It’s not very well put together, but I feel that Bran sitting on the throne at the end will be due to a lot more than “his powerful story”.',\n",

I don't disagree this was rape, but the argument is that it was rape because she had no means of refusing Tyrion.\\n\\nWe know that in Westeros, a husband has a right to sex with his wife whenever he wishes for it, and women have no choice but to submit to their husbands. \\n\\nSo, the question is, what prevents all marital sex from being rape in this case? The same thing holds true for wives and sex slaves: they cannot refuse or withhold sex. Is rape just an everyday reality for people in Westeros?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Much had been said on this sub and elsewhere about the possibility of Planetos as we know it in the ASOIAF novels experiencing an interregnum of high-tech, even space age, civilizations - right now our story taking place during more of a low point in which technology has regressed back into primarily medieval and early renaissance era weaponry, engineering and so forth. \\n\\nBut I just don’t see it. \\n\\nIt’d be ridiculous to claim there’s been a steady upwards trend for the last 10,000+ years we’ve been made aware of, but that’s true of our own world as well. And while obviously long ago there was some nature of global catastrophe that included the Long Night, but I see little to no hints whatsoever that a truly high-tech, advanced civilization as we know one has ever existed on Planetos. \\n\\nAre there amazing wonders and man-made structures that defy belief for the characters in our present story? Sure! The Wall, the massive Five Forts in Essos, the fused and oily black stone structures across the planet, such as the foundations of the Hightower or Storm’s End, among many other examples, not to mention what the Valyrians had accomplished before the Doom, speak to a time when engineering knowledge and magic were greater than now, but to me that in no way denotes the kind of technology that science fiction would entail. \\n\\nHow are these structures and marvels in any way different than that our ancient civilizations produced? To me they are analogues to, say, the Pyramids of Giza and how such massive feats would appear to not only the Classical Greeks and then Romans, but also the Medieval and Renaissance peoples of Earth. Heck even us today really. \\n\\nWhat am I missing? What hints in the myths and ruins of Planetos speak to a truly advanced technological society that cannot be explained as incredible ancient engineering combined with lost magical knowledge? \\n\\nI’d love to see any and all thoughts on how ASOIAF can be read as science fiction and not strictly fantasy!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I know the show has been discussed to death and all of our qualms with it have been well and truly expressed. However, something occurred to me the other day that, while it wouldn\\'t fix a lot, would definitely have made things a bit more logical and palatable.\\n\\nDelaying executing Littlefinger.\\n\\nA lot has been made and rightly so of how ridiculous Littlefinger\\'s \"trial\" and execution were. While the Starks know of his crimes because they believe Bran, pretty much everyone else is just taking their word for it and they summarily cut the throat of the Vale\\'s Regent. \\n\\nThe ridiculousness of this and everything leading up to it aside, D&amp;D were trying to wrap character arcs up and the quickest way to do that is killing them, right? But Petyr Baelish could have made the following season make *so much more sense.*\\n\\nA lot has been made about how the political machinations don\\'t really make any sense since everybody is essentially on the same side in the North from the get go of season 8. Sansa\\'s completely illogical dislike of Dany despite her coming to literally save them and being capable of burning them all to death if she wanted makes far more sense with someone that we know as a political agitator whispering in her ear. Sansa\\'s actions despite being the \"smartest person\" Arya knows are those of an imbecile. It would be logical that the \"master manipulator\" that Littlefinger is would be playing these two characters against each other *especially* if he had another goal in mind. One with dragons. \\n\\nHow much more sense would Dany\\'s arc into madness have made if she had someone with ill intent telling her the whole time that others are plotting against her? As it played out, she went crazy all on her own just because. The paranoia came out of freaking nowhere and there was absolutely no one stoking those embers, all just her being insecure about not being elected Prom Queen after The Long Night. Having been rejected by Sansa, Baelish now hitches his cart to another horse, one that\\'s a foreigner to Westeros with little love from the common people that Baelish manages to ingratiate himself with. \\n\\nThis also makes Varys\\' death make *way more sense.* You don\\'t even need to write in Varys\\' plotting against Dany at all, he can remain loyal to the end, he\\'s been Baelish\\'s biggest rival since the beginning and we could see Petyr finally managing to cleanse the earth of Varys on a bullshit charge. If Littlefinger found out about Jon\\'s lineage, he\\'d be the one to weaponize it but not as a means of putting Jon on the throne, as a means of getting rid of his rivals by framing them as traitors. \\n\\nThere\\'s so much that could have been done with Baelish in the final season to polish the turd. Hell, you could explain how Bronn got past the guards at Winterfell and found Jaime and Tyrion. In fact, him trying to play both sides would make the most sense. Feeding both sides misinformation about each other\\'s intents.\\n\\nYou could explain many, many characters\\' incredibly stupid decisions by having someone who is actively working against their interests being one of their chief advisers. \\n\\nThen it can all go the same way, with Sansa executing Littlefinger before we actually get to King\\'s Landing, but for crimes we get to see her reveal and an actual trial before the end. Also, the one who passes the sentence should swing the sword but that\\'s small fries in the grand scheme.\\n\\nAnyway, just some thoughts on a slow Monday work day. I know it most certainly doesn\\'t fix anything but it would have at least vacuumed the carpets of the Titanic as it was going down.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I\\'ve been waiting for discussion to come up in this sub since the video came out but I haven\\'t seen any, so I wanted to get the community\\'s thoughts on this theory. It\\'s worth watching the entire video for the details, but to summarize the points:  \\n\\n1. George himself suggested that the community would argue whether or not Jon was even really dead. It\\'s obviously unlikely that Jon could have survived being stabbed 4 times, so why would his death be ambiguous? \\n\\n2. Prior to the betrayal, Melisandre suggests that Jon will have need of her. Jon is wary about Melisandre\\'s power to predict the future, but given the situation involving Rattleshirt and Stannis, he knows with certainty that she can use personal items belonging to people to seal powerful glamours. Jon had previously confiscated Tormund\\'s golden armbands when the Wildlings passed south beneath the wall.\\n\\n3. Prior to the declaration in the Shield Hall, Tormund and Jon had a vague, private meeting on their action plan (\"They talked for the best part of two hours.\") Jon and Tormund have may have exchanged glamours in order to simultaneously fulfill Jon\\'s duty to the Wildlings and fulfill his personal desire to take action in Winterfell.\\n\\n4. Melisandre is also a master of shadowbinding. When Renly was killed by the Shadow with his face, Stannis saw the assassination occurring in real time despite being a few miles away. In this context, Jon may be able to see the actions occuring to the glamoured Tormund despite not being near him. This explains how Jon\\'s consciousness could be aware of the fourth and final stabbing despite not feeling the blade.\\n\\nPersonally, I thought Jon\\'s death and resurrection was a certainty, but one thing that I\\'ve always disliked about it was that it seemed too obvious and repetitive for a red priest to resurrect someone. After viewing this new video, however, I feel like this theory is correct.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Recently when I\\'ve had a few thoughts, etc. that I couldn\\'t seem to get a full posts worth of info into, I have been combining several of them and posting them as a group:\\n\\n[Random Thoughts, Musings Questions II](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ekesqf/random_thoughts_musings_questions_ii_spoilers/)\\n\\n[Random Thoughts, Musings Questions I](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/dtiuzk/random_thoughts_musings_questions_etc_spoilers/)\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Cortnay Penrose**\\n\\n&gt;\"Nothing from Bitterbridge. From Storm\\'s End, three birds from the castellan, Ser Cortnay Penrose, all carrying the same plea. Stannis has him surrounded by land and sea. He offers his allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege. **He fears for the boy, he says. What boy would that be, do you know?\"** \\n\\n&gt;**\"Edric Storm,\" Brienne told them. \"Robert\\'s bastard son.\"**\\n\\n&gt;…\\n\\n&gt;Edmure looked at her curiously. \"Stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free, unharmed, provided they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his hands, but Ser Cortnay will not consent.\"\\n\\n&gt;He risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even his own, Catelyn thought. \"Did you send him an answer?\" -ACOK, Catelyn V\\n\\nHe risks everything because Stannis demanded Edric Storm, which isn\\'t unreasonable seeing as though hostages are valuable and the Florents are behind Stannis. Do you think he heard rumors about Mel? What do you think made him \"fear for the boy\" seeing as he is Stannis\\' blood?\\n\\nObviously its very possible this was just a plot device used to drive forward Stannis\\' plotline.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Wylla Fenn and Lonnel \"Lonny\" Snow**\\n\\nI posted recently about the [She Wolves of Winterfell](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/eqisf1/what_we_know_the_she_wolves_of_winterfell/):\\n\\nDoes anyone think its possible that this pregnant woman is Wylla:\\n\\n&gt;He saw no more of his father, nor the girl who looked like Arya, but **a woman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her**. -ADWD, Bran III\\n\\nWylla was a member of House Fenn but was also the mother of Brandon\\'s bastard Lonnel. Brandon was married to Alys Karstark and had trueborn sons (Rodwell/Beron).\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Dorne\\'s Friends at Court**\\n\\nWho do you think is relaying info to Dorne from court in King\\'s Landing?\\n\\nPrince Doran took a jagged breath. \"**Dorne still has friends at court. Friends who tell us things we were not meant to know.** This invitation Cersei sent us is a ruse. Trystane is never meant to reach King\\'s Landing. On the road back, somewhere in the kingswood, Ser Balon\\'s party will be attacked by outlaws, and my son will die. I am asked to court only so that I may witness this attack with my own eyes and thereby absolve the queen of any blame. Oh, and these outlaws? They will be shouting, \\'Halfman, Halfman,\\' as they attack. Ser Balon may even catch a quick glimpse of the Imp, though no one else will.\"  -ADWD, The Watcher\\n\\nIts def. possible it is Varys, but he has gone into hiding at this point (still could get info though).\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Shadowbabies**\\n\\nWhile there is some confusion around just how many shadowbabies could be created and who can create them:\\n\\n&gt;\"Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart, then. Shadows only live when given birth by light, and **the king\\'s fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son. It might well kill him.**\" Melisandre moved closer. \"**With another man, though . . . a man whose flames still burn hot and high . . . if you truly wish to serve your king\\'s cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make** . . .\"  -ASOS, Davos III\\n\\nWe have seen how powerful they are:\\n\\n&gt;I beg you in the name of the Mother,\" Catelyn began **when a sudden gust of wind flung open the door of the tent. She thought she glimpsed movement, but when she turned her head, it was only the king\\'s shadow shifting against the silken walls**. She heard Renly begin a jest, **his shadow moving, lifting its sword, black on green, candles guttering, shivering, something was queer, wrong, and then she saw Renly\\'s sword still in its scabbard, sheathed still, but the shadowsword** . . . \\n\\n&gt;\"Cold,\" said Renly in a small puzzled voice, a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there. He had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat. -ACOK, Catelyn IV\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"Why no, I trust you implicitly.\" A bitter laugh echoed off the shuttered windows. **\"I trust you like one of my own blood, in truth. Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died.\"**\\n\\n&gt;\"It is said that he threw himself from a tower.\" \\n\\n&gt;\"Threw himself? No, I will not believe that!\" -ACOK, Tyrion X\\n\\nThis passage goes on to have Varys/Tyrion discuss magic, Varys\\'s cutting, etc. but the question/thought I have is do we have any other instances where a seemingly healthy individual who had no reason to want to die just happens to \"kill themselves\" in ASOIAF history? \\n\\nI haven\\'t looked into yet, but it would be cool to see if there was anything weird around the circumstances of some apparent suicides in history (ex: Jaehara Targaryen - I doubt it happened in this case, just an example of someone dying):\\n\\n&gt;The last living offspring of Aegon II, Jaehaera Targaryen was eight when she wed her cousin Aegon III, and ten when she threw herself from Maegor\\'s Holdfast to the spikes of the dry moat below. She lived on for half an hour, in agony, before she died. -TWOIAF: The Targaryen Kings: Aegon III\\n\\n***\\n\\nI\\'m sure several of these have been posted about in the past (if not all, its been 8 years), but I would love to discuss any of these points with anyone who has any thoughts. As I mentioned, feel free to make your own post, blog, etc. or even just provide links to previous theories about the above, I don\\'t mind.',\n",

Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Severed hands clutched bloody cups, wooden spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a **wolf**. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.\\n\\nThe symbolism here is obvious, so when you guys read the books for the first time without knowing about the Red Wedding, did you know then that Robb would die?

       "   'selftext': 'So we all know what a prodigious rider Lyanna was, to the point where she was likely the knight of the laughing tree, but what if she was more than just an excellent horsewomen?\\n\\nSkinchangers run in the Stark line, and Ned\\'s Siblings Lyanna and Brandon were even guarded as Centaurs, half horse, what if Brandon, and perhapse Lyanna were latent Skinchangers that melded with their mounts?\\n\\nPerhapse contrary to popular belief, herds of horses are not led by the Stallion, but by the Boss mare, while the Stallion guards the rear, Lyanna\\'s horse would presumably have been a mare and thus would impart some of its qualities upon her\\n\\n&gt;While a few mares may be somewhat more distractible or irritable when in heat, they are far less easily distracted than a stallion at any time. Solid training usually minimizes hormonal behavior. For competitive purposes, mares are sometimes placed on hormone therapies, such as the drug Regumate, to help control hormonally based behavior. Some riders also use various herbal remedies, most of which have not been extensively tested for effectiveness.\\n\\n&gt;Mares and geldings can be pastured together. However, mares may be a bit more territorial than geldings, even though they are far less territorial than stallions. Sex-segregating herds may make for less infighting, especially if kept in close quarters. However, studies also have shown that when a \"lead mare\" or \"boss mare\" is in charge of a herd, all remaining animals rest for longer periods and seem more at ease than do those in herds led by a gelding.\\n\\n&gt;!In wild herds, a \"boss mare\" or \"lead mare\" leads the band to grazing, to water, and away from danger. She eats and drinks first, decides when the herd will move and to where. The herd stallion usually brings up the rear and acts as a defender of the herd against predators and other stallions.\\n\\nPerhaps this contributes to Lyanna\\'s iron personality as Lead Mares are not owned by Stallions but rather the Stallions follow them, so Lyanna chafed at being promised to Robert, but was perhaps willing to run away with someone else.\\n\\nWe also see her protective matriarchal nature when she fights off three squires to save Howland.\\n\\nIt could all just be coincidence, but I thought it was interesting.',\n",

Knowing Cersei, if her strong paranoia ever got the best of her, and it always does, would go as far as to contact Jaime so that he could find her a maester or a woods witch who could brew moon tea to abort the potential growing Baratheon spawn. \\n\\nBut let’s say Jaime couldn’t find a maester or a woods witch in enough time and instead Cersei ended up becoming impregnated by Robert and bearing his seed in her womb. In about 9 moon turns/months, Cersei would go give birth to a child, a son, sharing the blood of both Lannister and Baratheon. \\n\\nNow this child could and would most likely share and inherit all of Robert’s traits and features as is believed by Jon Arryn or, maybe in a “miracle-like” fashion, and I use quotations around Miracle-like because this would possibly be the only caveat that would stop Cersei from snuffing the child out in his sleep, the child could be born with a head of golden Lannister hair and bright blue Baratheon eyes. This would not only serve as a flaw in Jon Arryn’s theory and cull his suspicions for a short while, but it would allow this hypothetical child to live and grow up in the world as the unknowing trueborn heir of the Seven Kingdoms. \\n\\nHow would things play out with this major game changer? If the child was born a year after Joffrey then that means the child would only be just a year younger than Joffrey at the beginning of A Game of Thrones, at 11 years old exactly and placing his birth at 287 AC. \\n\\nWould the war of five kings still be set off?? Would Stannis support Robert and Cersei’s son, if so? How would Cersei treat him? Would Robert show some interest in him?? \\n\\nI honestly feel like the birth of a trueborn son would only hold the war’s start for a shorter time than in canon but this thought has been on my mind for a good min, I’d like to know if anyone else shares the same thoughts on this matter.',\n",

I find it odd that Jon, the future lord commander of the Night’s Watch (who famously dress all in black) received a white direwolf (Ghost). I know it’s because he’s a bastard, and his colors would be a white wolf on a grey field (since Stark colors are a grey wolf on a white field). But since he went to the wall so soon, why not have his direwolf be black? In addition I would add that if he was to have a black direwolf, then there wouldn’t be an all white one, they would just all be the same grey as Nymeria, summer, etc. Just a thought.

       "   'selftext': 'Came across an interesting passage in TWOIAF that might hint at the direction a Greenseer King like Bran the Broken’s realm might take...\\n\\n&gt;These new Lorathi were worshippers of Boash, the Blind God. Rejecting all other deities, the followers of Boash ate no flesh, drank no wine, and walked barefoot through the world, clad only in hair shirts and hides. Their eunuch priests wore eyeless hoods in honor of their god; **only in darkness, they believed, would their third eye open, allowing them to see the “higher truths” of creation** that lay concealed behind the world’s illusions. The worshippers of Boash believed that all life was sacred and eternal; that men and women were equal; that lords and peasants, rich and poor, slave and master, man and beast were all alike, all equally worthy, all creatures of god.\\n\\nIt’s the single only reference to a “third eye” in the entire book so I can’t help but think it might be a little aside for us, hinting at what kind of realm King Bran would seek to rebuild from the aftermath of what’s looking to be a very devastating winter and invasion by the Others, not to mention Euron wrecking shit up.\\n\\nNote that I’m not saying even during Bran’s time on the throne might all this equality and outlook be achieved, but rather that he may set in motion a wheel that’ll keep turning in that direction.\\n\\n*Note - this is a repost because, believe it or not, the title I used previously was a violation of the sub’s rules.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'How much tinfoil is in ASOIAF?\\n\\nAt first this might sound like a joke question, but I‘m completely serious. Crazy, outlandish theories are often easily dismissed as \"tinfoil\" and people quickly move on. But how much tinfoil is actually part of ASOIAF?\\n\\nThink about it. We\\'re talking about a book series that is just filled with conspiracies. Illyrio\\'s mission to make (f)Aegon King, Littlefinger pretty much singlehandedly starting the Stark-Lannister war and generally being behind almost everything in the first three books, Chett\\'s conspiracy in the ASOS prologue and then later the mutiny at Craster\\'s Keep, the potential Maester conspiracy, the potential Northern conspiracy, whatever Doran Martell is planning, whatever the Tyrells are planning, whatever is going on with the Reeds/Daynes/Hightowers... I could go on! \\n\\nAnd I haven\\'t even mentioned the most important factor in all of this. The thing that most gets overlooked when arguing about tinfoil... magic. Skinchanging, Shadowbabies, Glass candles, prophecy, dreams, *time travel*. Speaking purely hypothetically, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that any given character at any given point is either being skinchanged by someone else  or in any other way magically manipulated through dreams or visions to do another person\\'s bidding. \\n\\nASOIAF is filled with characters experiencing strange, intense, sometimes reoccurring dreams. On first read you might dismiss these passages as mere flavour text, typical fantasy fare. Maybe there is some foreshadowing in there but that‘s about as much as we\\'ll get from these things. \\n\\nBut then you learn about green dreams. And then you learn about glass candles:\\n\\n&gt;The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one of these glass candles. **They could enter a man\\'s dreams and give him visions**, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles.\\n\\nAnd now the question becomes not \"what does this dream mean?\" but instead \"who sent this dream and for what purpose?\"\\n\\nNed\\'s Tower of Joy dream, Theon\\'s Red Wedding dream, Jaime\\'s dream before rescuing Brienne from the bear, Jon\\'s crypt dreams, Tyrion\\'s dragon dreams, all of Dany\\'s dreams in AGOT, Lancel\\'s dreams he receives from \"the Seven\", Maester Aemon\\'s dreams about Egg... Not to mention the *visions* portion of that quote. Does that include visions in flames? Are those being sent out by someone? *Who* is R\\'hllor anyway?\\n\\nLuckily GRRM is an extremely talented author with decades of experience. He knows that \"the only thing worth writing about is the humans heart in conflict with itself\". So I don\\'t think that literally every single event in our story was the result of some kind of supernatural manipulation. That would mean there was never any conflict to begin with, it was all planned. \\n\\nAnd yet. \\n\\nWe have seen very little actual magical interference in our story so far. At least *confirmed* interference. Dany and her dragons, Mel\\'s shadowbaby, some skinchanging here and there... But glass candles have been burning since the end of ACOK at least. Bloodraven has been sitting in his tree almost 50 years. People have been receiving visions and strange dreams for god know how long...\\n\\nI don\\'t think we\\'ll get definitive confirmation on how much magical manipulation was actually going on. That would just spoil the mystery. Did the pregnant direwolf cross the Wall on her own accord or was she being skinchanged by someone? Will we ever find out? \\n\\nI am making the prediction that we will see a lot more magical interventions in the coming books though. You don‘t just introduce these powerful tools like weirdwoods and glass candles and face-changing and then not utilise them in important ways (looking at you D&amp;D). \\n\\nAll I‘m saying for now is that we need to be careful when examining the story to not dismiss things as ludicrous just because they may seem so at first. ASOIAF may contain a lot more tinfoil than originally we thought.\\n\\n**Tl;dr: Don\\'t trust anything. Harrenhal was an inside job. Dragonfire can\\'t melt weirwood beams. Open your third eye.**',\n",

He then went to Westeros by DragonAirlines, ended the Long Night there, builded the fortress under the Hightower, founded House Dayne, renamed Lightbringer into Dawn and started the “Sword of the Morning” to prepare next generations for the upcoming return of the Others. \\n\\nThis would explain the valyrian traits of House Dayne, the parallelism between the legend of Starfall and the Black Stone and the similarities between “Dawn”, “The War for the Dawn”, “Lightbringer”, “Sword of the Morning”, etc.\\n\\nI’ve read the LmL posts on the GEotD and most of the counter-arguments used about it’s importance is that \\n 1. It is only named on TWoIaF\\n 2. It’s only purpose is world-building \\n\\nAnyway, I wanted to know what do you guys think about all this. Is it possible that this plays a major role on the endgame? Or is it just over-analyzing stuff intended to be worldbuilding and nothing more?\\n\\nP.S.: Let me know if there are any grammar mistakes, english is not my mother tongue.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Came across an interesting passage in TWOIAF that might hint at the direction a Greenseer King like Bran the Broken’s realm might take...\\n\\n&gt;These new Lorathi were worshippers of Boash, the Blind God. Rejecting all other deities, the followers of Boash ate no flesh, drank no wine, and walked barefoot through the world, clad only in hair shirts and hides. Their eunuch priests wore eyeless hoods in honor of their god; **only in darkness, they believed, would their third eye open, allowing them to see the “higher truths” of creation** that lay concealed behind the world’s illusions. The worshippers of Boash believed that all life was sacred and eternal; that men and women were equal; that lords and peasants, rich and poor, slave and master, man and beast were all alike, all equally worthy, all creatures of god.\\n\\nIt’s the single only reference to a “third eye” in the entire book so I can’t help but think it might be a little aside for us, hinting at what kind of realm King Bran would seek to rebuild from the aftermath of what’s looking to be a very devastating winter and invasion by the Others, not to mention Euron wrecking shit up.\\n\\nNote that I’m not saying even during Bran’s time on the throne might all this equality and outlook be achieved, but rather that he may set in motion a wheel that’ll keep turning in that direction.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"So this is a theory I have had for a while, and wanted to know what other  people thought about it.  Basically my theory is the Targaryen madness  is not a result of continuous incest (not exactly anyways) but instead,  from marrying outside of the Targaryen family, and than resuming the incest.  I will explain.\\n\\nWe  presumably believe the Targaryens were inbreeding on Dragonstone, the  Valyrians wed brother and sister all the time in Old Valyria but there  is no instance of any going insane.  Even if a Targaryen married had no  sister to marry, they married a cousin, or another valyrian family.  (house Velaryon).\\n\\nWe get Aegon and  his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya, who were perfectly sane.  Aenys was  not insane (just incapable and weak willed), I would not even consider  Maegor insane (cruel yes, but not truly insane).  So I believe the sons  of Aegon were perfect healthy, if a tad weak or cruel.\\n\\nNext  we have Aenys' children, all were perfect healthy, and sane.  While  Vaella died as a infant, I would put that more towards the time period,  as it is not stated she was a monster or anything.\\n\\nJaehaerys  married his sister, Alysanne, and all their children were perfectly  healthy.  Aegon died shortly after birth, but again, the time period and  the attempted assassination on Alysanne probably contributed to his  death.\\n\\nNow Prince Baelon (son of  Jaehaerys) ,married his sister, Alyssa, and had 2 perfectly fine children  and a baby who died young (again, not a monster).  That leads to  Viserys I, who's grandparents were siblings, and parents were siblings.  Viserys was not insane, he was a bit fat, a bit inactive, but perfectly  healthy.  But he did not marry his sister, but his cousin, Aemma  Arryn.  She gave him 2 children, Rhaenyra, and Baelon who died young  (not a monster).\\n\\nThan Viserys married someone who has not a drop of Targaryen blood, Alicent  Hightower, who had healthy children.  I would neither call Rhaenyra or  Aegon II truly insane, like others do, they were obsessed with what they saw as their birth right, yes, but not truly mad.  Aegon II married his  sister, Halaena, and now we are starting to see some problems.\\n\\nPrince Jaehaerys had 6 fingers on one hand, and 6 toes on each foot.  Jaehaera was slow, and I believe she was autistic the way she is described.  So  now we have a product of incest, after skipping a generation, and  finally some issues.\\n\\nRhaenyra had 5 healthy children, and one monster, Visenya.  Daemon was a Targaryen, so  this is definitely a incest union,  but one monster baby out of so many others, I am willing to overlook this one (maybe somebody else has a idea on this?)\\n\\nGoing forward, none  of Aegon II children had any of their own, so we move to Aegon III, who had no children with his cousin, but married a Velaryon.  All children  were okay, I suppose.  Daeron liked to be a warrior, but was healthy.   Baelor I think was simply a zealot, been plenty of those in our own history that was not from incest union, so I will put his mild craziness to that,  and his 3 daughters were locked in a maiden vault for many years, so  that can cause a bit of problems, but none of them were ever described  as insane.\\n\\nViserys II was a very able man, who could have been as great as Jaehaerys I, unfortunately he had a awful son.\\n\\nAegon  IV was not insane, just a ass hole.  Not a child of incest at all, his mother was someone of valyrian blood, though not Targaryen.  \\n\\nDaeron  II was a product of incest, as Aegon IV married his sister Naerys,  while Daeron II seemed to be spared any taint (sometimes incest babies  come out okay) his children, were not.  Aerys I was obsessed with prophecy  (and I believe this is why he never had children), Rhaegel was mad and  sickly, dancing naked throughout the Red Keep.\\n\\nMaekar  was sane, but his son Aerion was not, and died drinking wildfire.  His  other children were fine, but Maekar did not marry his sister.  Aegon  V's children were all perfectly sane, again he did not marry his sister,  and it seems Targaryen insanity was going away.\\n\\nJaehaerys  II ruined everything by marrying Shaera, and suddenly, after so much  marrying out of the family, the first incest king we get is the craziest of them all, Aerys II.  Complete lunacy, hearing voices and basically  causing the fall of House Targaryen.  Aerys married his sister, and  while Rhaegar was not completely insane, he was obsessed with prophecy  as well, Viserys is clearly insane (maybe less so than his father) and  Daenerys shows signs of being ruthless, and maybe has a bit of Targaryen  madness buried deep inside her, but we shall see in future books (if  you look at the show, she does go completely mad).\\n\\nI  did not mention all the monster Targaryen babies, while Maegor has  monster babies, I believe his wife (forget her name) was poisoning the  pregnant mothers, and that explains that away.  But Aerys II failure to  have more than 3 children, despite his wife being pregnant quite a bit,  and many other Targaryen baby problems, all seemed to come AFTER Viserys  I married outside of the Targaryen family with Alicent Hightower, and  than the Targaryens trying incest again.  Maybe Valyrians have  resistance to inbreeding defects, but marrying outside of that gene pool meant losing that protection, and suddenly the Targaryens were just like  everybody else, birth defects and all.  Maybe if the Targaryens kepts marrying brother and sister, or cousin to cousin, the madness would never have appeared?\\n\\nThoughts?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"So this is a theory I have had for a while, and wanted to know what other people thought about it.  Basically my theory is the Targaryen madness is not a result of continuous incest (not exactly anyways) but instead, from marrying outside of the Targaryen family, and than resuming the incest.  I will explain.\\n\\nWe presumably believe the Targaryens were inbreeding on Dragonstone, the Valyrians wed brother and sister all the time in Old Valyria but there is no instance of any going insane.  Even if a Targaryen married had no sister to marry, they married a cousin, or another valyrian family. (house Velaryon).\\n\\nWe get Aegon and his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya, who were perfectly sane.  Aenys was not insane (just incapable and weak willed), I would not even consider Maegor insane (cruel yes, but not truly insane).  So I believe the sons of Aegon were perfect healthy, if a tad weak or cruel.  \\n\\nNext we have Aenys' children, all were perfect healthy, and sane.  While Vaella died as a infant, I would put that more towards the time period, as it is not stated she was a monster or anything.\\n\\nJaehaerys married his sister, Alysanne, and all their children were perfectly healthy.  Aegon died shortly after birth, but again, the time period and the attempted assassination on Alysanne probably contributed to his death.\\n\\nNow Prince Baelon (son of Jaehaerys) ,arried his sister, Alyssa, and had 2 perfectly fine children and a baby who died young (again, not a monster).  That leads to Viserys I, who's grandparents were siblings, and parents were siblings.  Viserys was not insane, he was a bit fat, a bit inactive, but perfectly healthy.  But he did not marry his sister, but his cousion, Aemma Arryn.  She gave him 2 children, Rhaenyra, and Baelon who died young (not a monster).\\n\\nThan Viserys married someone who has not a drop of Targaryen blood, Alicent Hightower, who had healthy children.  I would neither call Rhaenyra or Aegon II truly insane, they were obsessed with what they saw as their birth right, yes, but not truly mad.  Aegon II ofcourse married his sister, Halaena, and now we are starting to see some problems.\\n\\nPrince Jaehaerys had 6 fingers on one hand, and 6 toes on each foot.  Jaehaera was slow, and I believe she was autistic the way she is described.  So now we have a product of incest, after skipping a generation, and finally some issues.\\n\\nRhaenyra had 5 healthy children, and one monster, Visenya.  Daemon was a Targaryen, so this is definitely a incest union,  but one monster baby out of so many others, I am willing to overlook this one (maybe somebody else has a idea on this?)\\n\\nGoing forward, none of Aegon II children had any of their own, so we move to Aegon III, who had no children with his cousin, but married a Velaryon.  All children were ok, I suppose.  Daeron liked to be a warrior, but was healthy.  Baelor I think was simply a zealot, been plenty of those in history that was not from incest union, so I will put his mild craziness to that, and his 3 daughters were locked in a maiden vault for many years, so that can cause a bit of problems, but none of them were ever described as insane.  \\n\\nViserys II was a very able man, who could have been as great as Jaehaerys I, unfortunately he had a awful son. \\n\\nAegon IV was not insane, he was perfectly sane.  Not a child of incest at all, but from someone of valyrian blood, though not Targaryen.  Aegon IV was a awful person in general, but he was for sure not insane.  \\n\\nDaeron II was a product of incest, as Aegon IV married his sister Naerys, while Daeron II seemed to be spared any taint (sometimes incest babies come out ok) his children, were not.  Aerys I was obsessed with prophecy (and I believe this is why he never had children), Rhaegel was mad and sickly, dancing naked throughout the Red Keep.\\n\\nMaekar was sane, but his son Aerion was not, and died drinking wildfire.  His other children were fine, but Maekar did not marry his sister.  Aegon V's children were all perfectly sane, again he did not marry his sister, and it seems Targaryen insanity was going away.\\n\\nJaehaerys II ruining everything by marrying Shaera, and suddenly, after so much marrying out of the family, the first incest king we get is the craziest of them all, Aerys II.  Complete lunacy, hearing voices and basically causing the fall of House Targaryen.  Aerys married his sister, and while Rhaegar was not completely insane, he was obsessed with prophecy as well, Viserys is clearly insane (maybe less so than his father) and Daenerys shows signs of being ruthless, and maybe has a bit of Targaryen madness buried deep inside her, but we shall see in future books (if you look at the show, she does go completely mad). \\n\\nI did not mention all the monster Targaryen babies, while Maegor has monster babies, I believe his wife (forget her name) was poisoning the pregnant mothers, and that explains that away.  But Aerys II failure to have more than 3 children, despite his wife being pregnant quite a bit, and many other Targaryen baby problems, all seemed to come AFTER Viserys I married outside of the Targaryen family with Alicent Hightower, and than the Targaryens trying incest again.  Maybe Valyrians have resistance to inbreeding defects, but marrying outside of that genepool meant losing that protection, and suddenly the Targaryens were just like everybody else, birth defects and all.\\n\\nThoughts?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '&gt;Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. \"**I am in need of guards myself**. These are perilous times.\" \\\\[...\\\\] \"**Hire the** **Mountain\\'s** **men**,\" Ser Kevan suggested. \"Red Ronnet will have no further use for them.\" He did not think that Mace Tyrell would be so clumsy as to try to murder either Pycelle or Swyft, but if guards made them feel safer, let them have guards.    *Epilogue, ADWD*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt the end of ADWD, Harys Swyft asks Kevan for guards and is suggested to hire Gregor\\'s men, who are in need of a master since Ser Robert Strong has become a kingsguard.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn Arya\\'s TWOW sample chapter *Mercy,* Raff the Sweetling (one of Gregor\\'s men) appears.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Mercy,\" he said. \"**My name is Raff**.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I know.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Mercy, TWOW*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe is part of Harys Swyft\\'s guard, which indicates that Harys did hire Gregor\\'s men (or atleast some of them). This means that the other men are also in Braavos and serving Harys.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt the end of the chapter, Arya kills Raff. However, it is possible that Raff was only the first of Gregor\\'s men to be killed by Arya in Braavos.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere are the Mountain\\'s men that we know about :\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* Chiswyck (killed by Jaqen as one of Arya\\'s 3 promised deaths)\\n* Polliver (killed by Sandor)\\n* Dunsen\\n* Raff the Sweetling (killed by Arya)\\n* Eggon\\n* The Tickler (killed by Arya)\\n* Joss Stilwood\\n* Tobott\\n* An unnamed squire of House Sarsfield (killed by Arya)\\n* Shitmouth\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is not hard to notice that Arya has played a major role in bringing an end to some of Gregor\\'s men. She has personally killed two of them in the main series and unless GRRM makes some heavy changes in TWOW with regard to Arya\\'s chapters, she has killed Raff the Sweetling too.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShe did not kill Chiswyck herself but she knew what she was doing when Jaqen asked her for a name and she gave Chiswyck\\'s name to him. Indirectly or no, Arya is somewhat responsible for his death as well.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTherefore, I would argue that Arya will kill the other men too (or atleast one of them) just as she killed Raff. There are 5 men supposedly still alive that we know of, including Dunsen, Joss Stilwood, Tobott, Shitmouth and Eggon.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAmong these, Dunsen is the most likely to become Arya\\'s next target.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Every night Arya would say their names. \"Ser Gregor,\" she\\'d whisper to her stone pillow. \"**Dunsen**, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.\"    *Arya VI, ACOK*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nArya added him to her list of people she wants to kill or just wants them to be dead. She has already killed three men from the list and it is likely that she will go after Dunsen as well after learning about his presence in Braavos.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nConsidering that Joss Stilwood is not lowborn like the other men, it is possible that he returned to his house after the war ended. Shitmouth could be spared by Arya, since he was nice to her and it\\'s why she did not add him to her list.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;The night she was caught, the Lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as their nasal helms, but she\\'d come to know them all. You had to know who was lazy and who was cruel, who was smart and who was stupid. **You had to learn that even though the one they called Shitmouth had the foulest tongue she\\'d ever heard, he\\'d give you an extra piece of bread if you asked**, while jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff would just give you the back of their hand.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEggon and Tobott have only been mentioned once in the entire series so it is hard to argue their fates.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nConsidering that Brienne spent AFFC journeying in the Riverlands and ended up killing the former members of the Brave Companions, it is possible that Arya will play a similar role in TWOW by killing Gregor\\'s men in Braavos.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"Those are Gregor\\'s men at Harrenhal,\" Jaime reminded her. \"**The Mountain liked them cruel and stupid.** Most like they ate your ravens, messages and all.\" \\\\[....\\\\]  **The only peace Ser Gregor\\'s lot had ever given anyone was the peace of the grave**.    *Jaime III, AFFC*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nJaime\\'s remarks of Gregor\\'s men shows that they are stupid and cruel. Raff the Sweetling was the only one who had any sense but he is now dead. Harys Swyft is a fool and lacks the authority to control them from committing atrocities.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nGregor\\'s men are used to raping, murdering, abusing, etc. They are also stupid enough to get in a fight with a bravo. If Arya does not kill all of them, it is still possible that they will die in other circumstances, such as in a fight with a bravo or getting arrested for raping, stealing, etc.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR Harys Swyft has hired Gregor\\'s men for guards. He took them to Braavos with him, including Raff the Sweetling. Raff is killed by Arya in her TWOW sample chapter. Arya has now killed four men who served Gregor. It is possible that she will kill the other men, especially Dunsen, who is in her list of people she wants to kill. Joss Stilwood is most probably still in Westeros and Shitmouth may be spared by Arya. Eggon and Tobott are two other men who are in danger as well.**',\n",

Jaime leaving King’s Landing, ditching Cersei and their unborn child, leaving her heartbroken. (Plunging the sword through his lovers breast).

       "   'selftext': 'I hear over and over again the Daynes love the Starks, that Edric is named after Ned, or they are secret hardcore Targaryen supporters. It\\'s fanon that\\'s become canon. Can someone explain why some fans believe this because it makes little sense to me. \\n\\n1) Allyria Dayne is betrothed to Beric Dondarrion from the Stormlands. There\\'s no indication that Beric was against Robert Baratheon or a secret Targ sympathizer—and we have heard hints about other families that haven\\'t fully accepted the Baratheon reign.\\n\\n2) Edric isn\\'t some crazy unusual name (we have Edric Storm, and Robert had nothing to do with him). It\\'s not like he was named Eddard. Why do people believe this is a tribute to Ned when other people have the name?\\n\\n3) Ned killed Arthur. Yes, he returned the sword, which was the right thing to do, but that one act doesn\\'t seem worthy of \"love\" or \"naming their heir after him.\" At the end of the day, he still killed their brother and family member. \\n\\n4) Dorne may be more sexually open, but we don\\'t hear about any other highborn Dornish ladies getting pregnant out of wedlock. If Ashara was pregnant, chances are that would be seen as a bad thing. Why would the Daynes look positively upon the man who \"shamed\" her then didn\\'t even bother to marry her? \\n\\n5) Ashara was Elia\\'s lady in waiting.  Perhaps they didn\\'t get along, but there\\'s no indication they did not and it\\'s likely they were friendly if she served her for a while. Why would she help Rhaegar cheat on his wife who literally just gave birth to his heir knowing a) the succession crises that have happened in the past b) how other regions look down on Dorne, and how being half Dornish in succession crises have been a problem in the past and c) knowing it could start a war (Laughing Storm rebellion?). Also, she\\'s from Dorne—if Rhaegar was so hell bent on a third head, she\\'d say get a mistress like Ellaria Sand who didn\\'t have the baggage that Lyanna did...\\n\\n6) It\\'s not just about the Martells. Elia and her kids were hostages, and it\\'s likely there were other Dornish people in here circle that were also held hostage. Thousands of Dornish people died. You don\\'t think the Daynes are going to be impacted by this when they likely knew that the cause was sparked by Rhaegar\\'s wandering dick...you don\\'t think they\\'d be upset at all the Dornish blood being spilled for such a dumb action that sparked a war? Arthur is sworn to the prince and his bff, doesn\\'t mean the rest of the Daynes feel the same exact way. \\n\\n7) Referring back to 6)....Ned still fought on the other side and likely killed some Dornishmen himself. Even if Ned was justified in the death of his father and brother and so on, he still was the \"enemy\" in some ways. \\n\\nIsn\\'t it more likely that Edric Dayne was a) being nice to Arya and b) trying to butter her up to find information about his alleged cousin instead of talking about some beloved figure of the Daynes? And it\\'s perfectly possible the Daynes did use Ned as an example of how the world isn\\'t black and white—that he was on the opposite side of the war and killed Arthur but was still a decent man. It doesn\\'t mean they loved him so much they named their heir after him.',\n",

Even if we argue that one\\'s thirties are still one\\'s youth, that leaves Mormont being friends with a baby. In his forties? Stroppy teenage Stannis. It\\'s hard to imagine what relationship could\\'ve existed that Stannis would, years later, do Mormont such a big favour.\\n\\nDoes anybody have any idea what\\'s going on?\\n\\nOne thin suggestion: maybe Mormont\\'s \"youth\" is his time prior to the Night\\'s Watch, maybe he met these men during the rebellion and even the Greyjoy rebellion, and he has for some reason lied about precisely when he joined the Night\\'s Watch, or is going senile.

But it’s not like they can’t defend themselves because there are instances in the books where they do.\\n\\nCersei: She kinda has an advantage since she probably has a minor knowledge in sword play since she used to dress up as Jaime as a kid and practiced with the master-at-arms.  And let’s not forget her deadly bitch slap she likes to compliment many of her male rivals. \\n\\nCatelyn: She’s had a few violent encounters during her time over her lifetime in the series. 1) When the Catspaw tried to kill Bran. 2) When the Mountain Clans attacked on the road to the Eyrie. 3) During the Red Wedding. An advantage she has over Cersei is that she’s probably stronger since she was able to fight off the Catspaw and break Edwyn Frey’s lip. She has no sword fighting experience though but her husband and son are good enough that she may have some very very basic knowledge.\\n\\nSo considering all off that who do you think could outmatch the other in a ruthless brawl',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I’m relatively new to this subreddit, and I’m sure that this topic has already been covered hundreds of times, but I didn’t see it, and I’m curious. Who has been theorized to be Azor Ahai so far in the books, and why? From what I’ve seen, everyone suggested had only matched part of the prophecy. Stannis pulled Lightbringer out of the fire, but he hasn’t awoken any stone dragons, and Lightbringer isn’t hot like it’s supposed to be. Daenaerys awoke the stone dragons, but she doesn’t have a flaming sword, unless maybe her dragons’ fire is a metaphorical sword. Melisandre sees Jon in her visions, but Jon hasn’t done anything distinctly Azor Ahai-like. Maybe he pulled the sword from the fire when he killed the wight in Mormont’s tower. Jeor says that he found Longclaw in the remains of his tower after the fire, and now Jon has it. However, I think this happened before the bleeding star though so that doesn’t quite work. What are some other theories that have been discussed on this sub?',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I’m relatively new to this subreddit, and I’m sure that this topic has already been covered, but I didn’t see it, and I’m curious. Who has been theorized to be Azor Ahai so far in the books, and why? From what I’ve seen, everyone suggested had only matched part of the prophecy. Stan is pulled Lightbringer out of the fire, but he hasn’t awoken any stone dragons, and Lightbringer isn’t hot like it’s supposed to be. Daenaerys awoke the stone dragons, but she doesn’t have a flaming sword, unless maybe her dragons’ fire is a metaphorical sword. Melisandre sees Jon in her visions, but Jon hasn’t done anything distinctly Azor Ahai-like. Maybe he pulled the sword from the fire when he killed the wight in Mormont’s tower. Jeor says that he found Longclaw in the remains of his tower after the fire, and now Jon has it. I think this happened before the bleeding star though so that doesn’t quite work. What are some other theories that have been discussed on this sub?',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nHello again,\\n\\nIn the last two books published, there are some points that are not very noticeable. I think that these points may emerge with the sixth book and we will continue to see its effect.\\n\\nWe read in the 4th and 5th books, Jon and Cersei talked with the representatives of the Iron Bank, and in the 6th book, Cersei sent a man of her own representative to ask for more money from the bank, and a representative from the same bank also made an agreement with Stannis.\\n\\nLet\\'s remember these scenes.\\n\\n* **Cersei**\\n\\n&gt;\"Though large, the crown incomes are not large enough to keep abreast of Robert\\'s debts. Accordingly, I have decided to defer our repayment of the sums owed the Holy Faith and the Iron Bank of **Braavos** until war\\'s end.\" The new High Septon would doubtless wring his holy hands, and the Braavosi would squeak and squawk at her, but what of it? \"The monies saved will be used for the building of our new fleet.\"  \\n\"Your Grace,\" Pycelle said in a quavering voice, \"this will cause more trouble than you know, I fear. The Iron Bank . . .\"  \\n\". . . remains on **Braavos**, far across the sea. They shall have their gold, maester. A Lannister pays his debts.\"  \\n\"The Braavosi have a saying too.\" Pycelle\\'s jeweled chain clinked softly. \"The Iron Bank will have its due, they say.\"  \\n\"The **Iron** **Bank** will have its due when I say they will. Until such time, the **Iron** **Bank** will wait respectfully..\"\\n\\nPycelle warned her wisley but she doesn\\'t want to see.\\n\\n&gt;**Noho** **Dimittis**, the **Braavosi** named himself. An irritating name for an irritating man. His voice was irritating too. Cersei shifted in her seat as he went on, wondering how long she must endure his hectoring. Behind her loomed the Iron Throne, its barbs and blades throwing twisted shadows across the floor. Only the king or his Hand could sit upon the throne itself. Cersei sat by its foot, in a seat of gilded wood piled with crimson cushions.  \\nWhen the Braavosi paused for breath, she saw her chance. \"This is more properly a matter for our lord treasurer.\"  \\nThat answer did not please the noble **Noho**, it would seem. \"I have spoken with Lord Gyles six times. He coughs at me and makes excuses, Your Grace, but the gold is not forthcoming.\"  \\n\"Speak to him a seventh time,\" Cersei suggested pleasantly. \"The number seven is sacred to our gods.\"  \\n...  \\n\"King Robert—\"  \\n\"—is dead,\" she said sharply. \"The **Iron** **Bank** **will have its gold when this rebellion has been put down.**\"  \\nHe had the insolence to scowl at her. \"Your Grace—\"  \\n\"This audience is at an end.\" Cersei had suffered quite enough for one day. \"Ser Meryn, show the noble **Noho** Dimittis to the door. Ser Osmund, you may escort me back to my apartments.\"\\n\\nAs you can see, the meeting with the representative is not going well, probably the man felt humiliated. Nobody can call the Braavos people has no pride, I guess. They are fond of debt and honor to pay even the ships they stole from Valyria years ago. They are not people to act emotionally, no doubt, as long as they collect their debts. There is no doubt that Noho\\'s report to the bank will be negative.\\n\\n* **Kevan/Harry and Braavos**\\n\\n&gt;\"The magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,\" said Ser Kevan... \"If that fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the **Iron** **Bank** yourself.\"  \\nSer Harys quailed. \"Must I?\"  \\n\"You are the **master** of **coin**,\" Lord Randyll said sharply.  \\n\"I am.\" The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft\\'s chin quivered in outrage... Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. \"I am in need of guards myself. These are perilous times.\"  \\n\"Hire the Mountain\\'s men,\" Ser Kevan suggested. \"Red Ronnet will have no further use for them.\"\\n\\n* **Jon ve Braavos**\\n\\n&gt;\"And here we have the honorable **Tycho** **Nestoris**, an emissary of the **Iron Bank of Braavos**, come to treat with His Grace King Stannis.\"  \\nThe banker doffed his hat and made a sweeping bow. \"Lord Commander. I thank you and your brothers for your hospitality.\" He spoke the Common Tongue flawlessly, with only the slightest hint of accent. Half a foot taller than Jon, the Braavosi sported a beard as thin as a rope sprouting from his chin and reaching almost to his waist. His robes were a somber purple, trimmed with ermine. A high stiff collar framed his narrow face. \"I hope we shall not inconvenience you too greatly.\"  \\n...  \\nA debt.\" What else could it be? \"His own debt?

In the 4th month, Arya meets (as the Cat of the Channels) and Sam in Braavos. In the 7th month, Jon meets with the representative (Selyse also arrives) and at the earliest week of the 8th month, the representative meets with Stannis and signs the agreement. At the end of this month, Jon is dead.

He had to fix this.)*\\n\\n**Here are the points that draw attention from the above issues.**\\n\\n1. Cersei, by talking with the representative, stops the payments and uses the excuse for \"revolt\".\\n2. Kevan tells Harry to go to Braavos. \"Hold the men of the Mountain,\" he says. We assume that he left after Kevan\\'s death and Cersei\\'s trial.\\n3. When the representative comes to the wall, he tells Jon, \"There was ice in the channels,\" and he says that the throne has stopped payments.\\n4. Stannis signs the agreement with Braavos. And the representative says that he wants to see him on the throne. \"To get your gold,\" Stannis answers.\\n\\n***Now we will talk a little more about timing.***\\n\\nIn the 4th book (AFoC) book we saw in Jaime POV that \"snow\" started to rain on the river lands. We know that Arya also saw this through Nymeria.\\n\\nThen we see that in the chapter of Kevan, it started to snow in KL. At least one or two months between Jaime POV. (But still the fall)\\n\\n&gt;The three men walked together from the throne room. **Outside the snow was swirling round the outer ward,** a caged beast howling to be free.\\n\\nKevan again.\\n\\n&gt;The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a **full** **moon** floated fat and white as a snowball.\\n\\nThere is a full moon in the sky.\\n\\nWinter Winds, Mercy POV .... We see Harry coming to Braavos with the men of the Mountain. At the beginning of POV, she also gives us information that helps with time.\\n\\n&gt;There had been blood in it, though, and a **full** **moon** overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.\\n\\nThere is a full moon in the sky again. So there is about (at least) a month between Kevan POV and Mercy POV.\\n\\n&gt;She had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy **green** rainwater stewing in the cistern out back.  \\n...  \\neven the Titan\\'s bronze shoulders, off across the dark **green** waters.  \\n...  \\nHis words echoed hollowly off the swirling **green** waters and the walls of unseen buildings.  \\n....  \\nShe could see the **green** water of the little canal below\\n\\nWe have not seen \"ice\" in the channels in any previous POV of Arya, including Mercy POV; channels and waters are always described as \"normal-green\". The weather is also generally foggy, cold and damp in Braavos where there is a lot of fog in the last Mercy POV.\\n\\nIn summary, the last Arya POV did not have any snow or the channels did not press cold enough to keep ice in Braavos; **which means that Tycho has not left Braavos yet.**\\n\\n**Mercy decides to kill Raff and kills. After saying this, it draws attention to an important point.**\\n\\n&gt;\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,\" she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she\\'d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. **This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.**\\n\\nMercy probably portrays the character of Shae; She\\'s been talking about rape and murder since the beginning of POV… She talks too much about it. If we look at what Mercy says, why would Mercy\\'s disappearance cause problems for the Envoy and the Sea Lord?\\n\\nBecause they will think that something Mercy has said has happened since the beginning of the chapter.\\n\\nThey last saw Mercy with Raff. Even Daena said they were \"wild\" she should to avoid these guys.\\n\\n&gt;\"... And Westerosi. They\\'re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.\"\\n\\nSome time after the theater is over, no one will be able to find Sweet Raff and Mercy. They will go to the girl\\'s house and see the “bloody floor”. They will think the worst. It is likely that both sides will blame each other (rape-murder, etc.), which will cause tension between the Braavos and Westeros.\\n\\nMore precisely, this probably happened, we haven\\'t read it yet, and we\\'ve seen its effect in the 5th and 6th books - we will continue to see it.\\n\\nCersei has already refused to give the money, demanding more money on top. As if these were not enough, one of the men of the Westeros ambassador raped and killed a girl from Braavos, and he fled. The ambassador\\'s \"demand for money\" issue will not be able to achieve any result with all this ... As a result, Braavos\\' Iron Bank decided to take action against the throne and therefore sent an envoy to Stannis.\\n\\n&gt;\"The Braavosi have a saying too.\" Pycelle\\'s jeweled chain clinked softly. \"The Iron Bank will have its due, they say.\"  \\n...  \\nThe Iron Bank will have its due, it is said. **Those who borrow from the Braavosi and fail to repay their debts oft have cause to rue such folly, for the Bank has been known to topple lords and princes** and has also been rumored to send assassins against those it cannot remove (though this has never been conclusively proved).\\n\\nIt would be a correct inference to say that the Iron Bank acted against the throne after the Cersei and the envoy issue. As a result, the bank does not want to take risks by giving money to the borrower\\'s enemy, while trying to get back its own money. If the bank took action, the only reason for this is because they decided to take action against Cersei.\\n\\nWhen we look at his conversation with Stannis, we already see the “opponent support” event. He talks about his brother\\'s and Joffrey\\'s take debts from Braavos. When Stannis came to the throne, he promised money that he would pay the debts of the \"throne\" and signed the agreement.\\n\\n&gt;**\"The debts belong to the Iron Throne**,\" Tycho declared, \"and whosoever sits on that chair must pay them. Since young King Tommen and his counsellors have become so obdurate, **we mean to broach the subject with King Stannis. Should he prove himself more worthy of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he needs.\"**  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;You are a worse pirate than Salladhor Saan...  \\n**\"I hope to have the honor of calling on Your Grace again when you are seated on your Iron Throne.\"**  \\n\"**You hope to have your gold, you mean**\\n\\nWhat happens when Stannis dies? Will Braavos support Aegon and Dany? As a result, candidates who want the throne and they will need money either way or another. Braavos had previously made agreements with Targaryen and his dragons. Despite this, can he send an \"assassin\" instead of spending more money? Can we see they will send one of the FMs and see Tommen die that way? This boy will die. Why would an 8-9-year-old child die if something like the plague would not be caught?\\n\\nResult? Thanks to Arya. :D\\n\\nThank you for read.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello again,\\n\\nIn the last two books published, there are some points that are not very noticeable. I think that these points may emerge with the sixth book and we will continue to see its effect.\\n\\nWe read in the 4th and 5th books, Jon and Cersei talked with the representatives of the Iron Bank, and in the 6th book, Cersei sent a man of her own representative to ask for more money from the bank, and a representative from the same bank also made an agreement with Stannis.\\n\\nLet\\'s remember these scenes.\\n\\n* **Cersei**\\n\\n&gt; \"Though large, the crown incomes are not large enough to keep abreast of Robert\\'s debts. Accordingly, I have decided to defer our repayment of the sums owed the Holy Faith and the Iron Bank of **Braavos** until war\\'s end.\" The new High Septon would doubtless wring his holy hands, and the Braavosi would squeak and squawk at her, but what of it? \"The monies saved will be used for the building of our new fleet.\"   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Your Grace,\" Pycelle said in a quavering voice, \"this will cause more trouble than you know, I fear. The Iron Bank . . .\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\". . . remains on **Braavos**, far across the sea. They shall have their gold, maester. A Lannister pays his debts.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"The Braavosi have a saying too.\" Pycelle\\'s jeweled chain clinked softly. \"The Iron Bank will have its due, they say.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"The **Iron** **Bank** will have its due when I say they will. Until such time, the **Iron** **Bank** will wait respectfully..\"\\n\\nPycelle warned her wisley but she doesn\\'t want to see. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;**Noho** **Dimittis**, the **Braavosi** named himself. An irritating name for an irritating man. His voice was irritating too. Cersei shifted in her seat as he went on, wondering how long she must endure his hectoring. Behind her loomed the Iron Throne, its barbs and blades throwing twisted shadows across the floor. Only the king or his Hand could sit upon the throne itself. Cersei sat by its foot, in a seat of gilded wood piled with crimson cushions.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;When the Braavosi paused for breath, she saw her chance. \"This is more properly a matter for our lord treasurer.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;That answer did not please the noble **Noho**, it would seem. \"I have spoken with Lord Gyles six times. He coughs at me and makes excuses, Your Grace, but the gold is not forthcoming.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Speak to him a seventh time,\" Cersei suggested pleasantly. \"The number seven is sacred to our gods.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; ...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"King Robert—\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"—is dead,\" she said sharply. \"The **Iron** **Bank** **will have its gold when this rebellion has been put down.**\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;He had the insolence to scowl at her. \"Your Grace—\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"This audience is at an end.\" Cersei had suffered quite enough for one day. \"Ser Meryn, show the noble **Noho** Dimittis to the door. Ser Osmund, you may escort me back to my apartments.\" \\n\\nAs you can see, the meeting with the representative is not going well, probably the man felt humiliated. Nobody can call the Braavos people has no pride, I guess. They are fond of debt and honor to pay even the ships they stole from Valyria years ago. They are not people to act emotionally, no doubt, as long as they collect their debts. There is no doubt that Noho\\'s report to the bank will be negative.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*  **Kevan/Harry and Braavos** \\n\\n&gt; \"The magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,\" said Ser Kevan... \"If that fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the **Iron** **Bank** yourself.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Ser Harys quailed. \"Must I?\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"You are the **master** of **coin**,\" Lord Randyll said sharply.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I am.\"  The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft\\'s chin quivered in outrage... Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. \"I am in need of guards myself. These are perilous times.\"   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"Hire the Mountain\\'s men,\" Ser Kevan suggested. \"Red Ronnet will have no further use for them.\"   \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*  **Jon ve Braavos**  \\n\\n&gt;\"And here we have the honorable **Tycho** **Nestoris**, an emissary of the **Iron Bank of Braavos**, come to treat with His Grace King Stannis.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The banker doffed his hat and made a sweeping bow. \"Lord Commander. I thank you and your brothers for your hospitality.\" He spoke the Common Tongue flawlessly, with only the slightest hint of accent. Half a foot taller than Jon, the Braavosi sported a beard as thin as a rope sprouting from his chin and reaching almost to his waist. His robes were a somber purple, trimmed with ermine. A high stiff collar framed his narrow face. \"I hope we shall not inconvenience you too greatly.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;A debt.\" What else could it be? \"His own debt? Or his brother\\'s?\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The banker pressed his fingers together. \"It would not be proper for me to discuss Lord Stannis\\'s indebtedness or lack of same. As to King Robert … it was indeed our pleasure to assist His Grace in his need. For so long as Robert lived, all was well. **Now, however, the Iron Throne has ceased all repayment.**\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Could the Lannisters truly be so foolish? \"You cannot mean to hold Stannis responsible for his brother\\'s debts.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; **\"The debts belong to the Iron Throne**,\" Tycho declared, \"and whosoever sits on that chair must pay them.

Should he prove himself more worthy of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he needs.\"** \\n\\nThe representative gives a remarkable detail about “time”.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; \"**Winter** is nigh upon us. The day I left **Braavos**, there was **ice on the canals.\"** \\n\\n \\n\\n* **Stannis ve Braavos**\\n\\n&gt; The king\\'s voice was choked with anger. \"You are a worse pirate than Salladhor Saan...  **My brother\\'s debts,\" the king was muttering. \"Joffrey\\'s too, though that baseborn abomination was no kin to me.\"** Theon twisted in his chains. He knew that voice. Stannis.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Your Grace,\" a second voice said softly. \"Pardon, but your ink has frozen.\" The Braavosi, Theon knew. What was his name? **Tycho**... **Tycho** something... \"Perhaps a bit of heat... ?\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I know a quicker way.\" Stannis drew his dagger. For an instant Theon thought that he meant to stab the banker. You will never get a drop of blood from that one, my lord, he might have told him. The king laid the blade of the knife against the ball of his left thumb, and slashed. \"There. I will sign in mine own blood. That ought to make your masters happy.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"If it please Your Grace, it will please the **Iron** **Bank**.\"   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; Stannis dipped a quill in the blood welling from his thumb and scratched his name across the piece of parchment. \"You will depart today. Lord Bolton may be on us soon. I will not have you caught up in the fighting.\"   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; \"That would be my preference as well.\" The Braavosi slipped the roll of parchment inside a wooden tube. **\"I hope to have the honor of calling on Your Grace again when you are seated on your Iron Throne.\"**   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"**You hope to have your gold, you mean**. Save your pleasantries. It is coin I need from Braavos, not empty courtesy. Tell the guard outside I have need of Justin Massey.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"It would be my pleasure.

As a result, Braavos\\' Iron Bank decided to take action against the throne and therefore sent an envoy to Stannis.\\n\\n&gt;\"The Braavosi have a saying too.\" Pycelle\\'s jeweled chain clinked softly. \"The Iron Bank will have its due, they say.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;...  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The Iron Bank will have its due, it is said. **Those who borrow from the Braavosi and fail to repay their debts oft have cause to rue such folly, for the Bank has been known to topple lords and princes** and has also been rumored to send assassins against those it cannot remove (though this has never been conclusively proved). \\n\\nIt would be a correct inference to say that the Iron Bank acted against the throne after the Cersei and the envoy issue. As a result, the bank does not want to take risks by giving money to the borrower\\'s enemy, while trying to get back its own money. If the bank took action, the only reason for this is because they decided to take action against Cersei.\\n\\nWhen we look at his conversation with Stannis, we already see the “opponent support” event. He talks about his brother\\'s and Joffrey\\'s take debts from Braavos. When Stannis came to the throne, he promised money that he would pay the debts of the \"throne\" and signed the agreement. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;**\"The debts belong to the Iron Throne**,\" Tycho declared, \"and whosoever sits on that chair must pay them. Since young King Tommen and his counsellors have become so obdurate, **we mean to broach the subject with King Stannis. Should he prove himself more worthy of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he needs.\"** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;You are a worse pirate than Salladhor Saan...   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**\"I hope to have the honor of calling on Your Grace again when you are seated on your Iron Throne.\"**   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"**You hope to have your gold, you mean**\\n\\nWhat happens when Stannis dies? Will Braavos support Aegon and Dany? As a result, candidates who want the throne and they will need money either way or another. Braavos had previously made agreements with Targaryen and his dragons. Despite this, can he send an \"assassin\" instead of spending more money? Can we see they will send one of the FMs and see Tommen die that way? This boy will die. Why would an 8-9-year-old child die if something like the plague would not be caught? \\n\\nResult? Thanks to Arya. :D\\n\\nThank you for read.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The biggest mystery in the series is whatever happened with Lyanna after the tourney at Harrenhal and her death; those facts have been carefully guarded. Arguably the second-biggest mystery is whatever the heck is going on with the Daynes. For that reason, I have read and re-read the section of ADWD where Barristan Selmy remembers both the Harrenhal tourney and his lost crush, Ashara. I\\'d like to re-examine a line from that and discuss a theory about the \"Stark\" that Ashara \"looked to\" that I don\\'t think has gotten quite enough close attention.\\n\\nLet\\'s begin by reminding ourselves of the now-famous, oft-analyzed POV line from Barristan Selmy:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;\"If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of Stark? He would never know. But of all his failures, none haunted Barristan Selmy so much as that\"\\n\\nThe obvious reading of this sentence is that Barristan thinks if he\\'d won the tourney and crowned Ashara, she\\'d have fallen in love with him. But I like to play with the idea that this is a very cleverly written line to lead readers in that direction, while not contradicting a future reveal: **that the Stark in question here is Lyanna, and that Barristan\\'s regrets have less to do with his love life than with Robert\\'s Rebellion.**\\n\\n# Why the obvious interpretation is suspect\\n\\nLet\\'s stop to re-examine the obvious, lead-the-reader-down-the-primrose path interpretation. Barristan is sworn to celibacy, so why would it *matter* if Ashara falls in love with him? They can never be together. (Barristan isn\\'t Ser Arys Oakheart, one to break his vows with a beautiful Dornish lady.)\\n\\nMoreover, why would *this* particular failure haunt Barristan so much *more* than any other? This is not a guy who dwells on his personal life to that extent -- especially when the relationship never had any chance of being consummated. He thinks mostly about the realm, duty, obeying his vows, and protecting his rightful monarch no matter the cost or risk (remember Duskendale?).\\n\\nSo let\\'s take another look at his cryptic remark, following his train of thought carefully:\\n\\n1. Barristan loses the tourney to Rhaegar;\\n2. As a result, Rhaegar crowns Lyanna queen of love and beauty;\\n3. Consequently, Ashara looks to an unspecified Stark.\\n4. DEEP regrets ensue.\\n\\nIt seems weird that Barristan doesn\\'t say the first name of the Stark in this sentence. There could be a couple of different reasons -- but the most obvious, if we pull ourselves out of the story for a minute and assume a bird\\'s-eye view -- is that **GRRM** ***wants*** **to conceal from the reader which Stark it is**. (It\\'s the same reason he hides other details from us -- to mess with readers and surprise us later on. He will tell us which Stark it is when he\\'s good and ready.) If it were Ned Stark, I think GRRM would have Barristan just come out and say so. \\n\\n# Syntax as evidence\\n\\nUndoubtedly, the line does give the impression of a male Stark, since men are more often referred to by their last names than women are. But this, too, could be misdirection. And what if this isn\\'t the first reference to a particular Stark in this train of thought, but a second reference? It wouldn\\'t be odd to refer to someone by only half of their name on a *second* reference. \\n\\nIn fact, that is the exact assumption most readers make -- that it\\'s a second reference to the \"man who dishonored \\\\[Ashara\\\\] at Harrenhal,\" which Selmy is thinking about earlier in the same section. Many readers leap to the assumption that \"Stark\" is a second reference to the man who who dishonored her, but we don\\'t know that.\\n\\nAnd what if there\\'s a different Stark mentioned in even *closer* conjunction to the particular \"Stark\" Ashara looked to? In fact, there is -- the mention of the queen of love and beauty Rhaegar crowned, who we know to be Lyanna. **Selmy doesn\\'t have to specify** ***Lyanna*** **Stark if he\\'s just been thinking of her, half a heartbeat earlier, in the very same sentence.**\\n\\nNotice the proximity between the Stark Ashara \"looks to\" and the Stark Rhaegar singles out:\\n\\n&gt;If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara **queen of love and beauty,** might she have looked to me instead of **Stark?**\\n\\n**Why would Rhaegar\\'s crowning of Lyanna lead to Ashara looking to a Stark? Because Lyanna** ***is*** **the Stark in question.**\\n\\n# \"Looked to\" is purposely vague\\n\\nThere\\'s a reason Selmy says \"looked to\" and not \"fallen for\" -- GRRM is toying with us. Readers often assume \"looked to\" means love -- or at least, sex -- in part because of the context of the broader paragraph, which is Selmy ruminating on his unrequited crush, and because we\\'ve been exposed to several third-hand rumors that Ned and Ashara fell in love. But as many readers have since pointed out, \"looked to\" is ambiguous. It could be something else entirely -- like a request for help. \\n\\nFollow me, if you will, further out onto this (admittedly wobbly) limb. Why does Rhaegar crown Lyanna queen of love and beauty? The story we\\'re supposed to believe is that this is the first sign of Rhaegar\\'s mad passion for Lyanna. (Set aside, for now, the fact that Rhaegar is never described as passionate by anyone, but instead as dutiful, able, single-minded, and crazily intelligent.) Brandon and Ned are immediately displeased. Ned seethes quietly, while Brandon gets visibly enraged. Notably, in WOIAF, Robert is \\\\*not\\\\* seen to be angry at this point, and laughs it off (at least in public) saying that Rhaegar was just giving Lyanna her due. So why are Ned and Brandon so *angry*?\\n\\nPerhaps because, at this point, only Lyanna\\'s brothers know that she is the Knight of the Laughing Tree, who Aerys has denounced as an enemy; when Rhaegar crowns her, that\\'s the moment they realize that he has it figured out. That\\'s dangerous for Lyanna! Robert, who has spent most of the tourney playing drinking games and doesn\\'t seem to know that Lyanna was the mystery knight, doesn\\'t pick up on it.\\n\\n**But Ashara\\'s haunting violet eyes don\\'t miss a beat.** Because Rhaegar singles Lyanna out, Ashara realizes she\\'s the courageous Knight of the Laughing Tree, and \"looks to\" Lyanna Stark later when he needs help.\\n\\nBarristan knows that he would *never* have gotten together with Ashara, so why does her \"looking to Stark\" haunt him so? Perhaps because **Ashara\\'s \"looking to\" was not about romance but about something Barristan could actually provide -- like help.** If Ashara\\'s \"looking to Stark\" was about seeking help from Lyanna Stark, then it would make sense for it to haunt Barristan deeply if the result was political chaos and war.\\n\\n# It\\'s Not About Love\\n\\nIn fact, the greater context of this moment in the story is not Barristan\\'s personal regrets -- but \"plots, ploys, whispers, lies, secrets within secrets\" of Meereen, which remind Barristan of plots back in Westeros:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Perhaps by now he should have grown used to such things. **The Red Keep had its secrets too.** ***Even Rhaegar*****. The Prince of Dragonstone had never trusted him as he had trusted Arthur Dayne. Harrenhal was proof of that.** *The year of the false spring*.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The memory was still bitter. Old Lord Whent had announced the tourney shortly after a visit from his brother, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard. With Varys whispering in his ear, King Aerys became convinced that his son was conspiring to depose him... suddenly he announced that he would accompany Prince Rhaegar to Harrenhal, and **everything had gone awry from there**.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*If I had been a better knight...* ***if I had unhorsed the prince in that last tilt****, as I unhorsed so many others,* ***it would have been for me to choose*** *the queen of love and beauty....*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**Rhaegar had chosen Lyanna Stark** of Winterfell.\\n\\nIt\\'s clear that **although Selmy was infatuated with Ashara Dayne, the bigger source of his bitterness is the larger political picture**.\\n\\n# In Conclusion\\n\\nPersonally, while I know how fragile the evidence is -- that\\'s why it\\'s such a fun mystery to discuss -- I love the idea of beautiful Ashara turning to fearless Lyanna for help. Yes, it would be unusual for a female character to be referred to by her last name only, but it would also be a fantastic way to drop a clue while ensuring that most readers would miss it on their first read. GRRM likes to put in little lines like this that, on re-reads, make you slap your forehead and go, \"D\\'OH!\" \\n\\n**The gender confusion here would also be an echo of Lyanna\\'s role as the Knight of the Laughing Tree** \\\\-- once again, people are assuming a mystery Stark is a man, when in fact it\\'s Lyanna. This puts the reader in the same role as the observers at the tourney! There\\'s even a fun parallel here with Arya, who is often in disguise as, or confused for, a boy, and is also considered the Stark most like Lyanna among the current generation of Starklets. I can totally see someone referring to tomboyish Arya as \"Stark\" instead of her first name.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** **The Stark Ashara \"looked to\" after Harrenhal could well have been Lyanna,** who is referred to implicitly earlier in the same sentence, in the reference to the queen of love and beauty crowned by Rhaegar. When Rhaegar singled out Lyanna Stark at Harrenhal, it drew Ashara\\'s attention to her. She realized, as so many readers have, that Lyanna was the Knight of the Laughing Tree, and later, when Ashara needed help, she looked to the valiant young woman her prince (and brother\\'s best friend) had already pointed to. If Barristan had unhorsed Rhaegar, Lyanna\\'s identity as the Knight of the Laughing Tree would have stayed secret, and when Ashara needed help she would have asked someone else, not Lyanna. Barristan thinks if he\\'d crowned Lyanna, she would have turned to him, preventing the subsequent events were that led to the rebellion.  \\n\\n\\n*If you made it to the end of this ridiculously long thing, thank you!*',\n",

This was where they came when the warmth had seeped out of their bodies; this was the dark hall of the dead, where the living feared to tread. -ACOK, Bran VII\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Lord Beron dies of a wound he gets fighting the Ironborn**\\n\\n&gt;**Lord Beron Stark, who made common cause with Casterly Rock to war against Dagon Greyjoy**, Lord of Pyke, in the days when the Seven Kingdoms were ruled in all but name by the bastard sorcerer men called Bloodraven. -ADWD, The Turncloak\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;Dunk frowned. \"Egg and I have a long journey before us. **We\\'re headed north to Winterfell. Lord Beron Stark is gathering swords to drive the krakens from his shores for good.\"**\\n\\n&gt;\"Too cold up there for me,\" said Ser Maynard. \"If you want to kill krakens, go west. The Lannisters are building ships to strike back at the iron-men on their home islands. That\\'s how you put an end to Dagon Greyjoy. Fighting him on land is fruitless, he just slips back to sea. You have to beat him on the water.\" -The Mystery Knight\\n\\nand:\\n\\n&gt;\"Some never will,\" Dunk told him. \"It doesn\\'t matter what you do. Others, though… they\\'re not all the same. I\\'ve met some good ones.\" He thought a moment. **\"When the tourney\\'s done, Egg and I mean to go north. Take service at Winterfell, and fight for the Starks against the ironmen.** You could come with us.\" The north was a world all its own, Ser Arlan always said. No one up there was like to know the tale of Penny Jenny and the Knight of the Pussywillows. No one will laugh at you up there. They will know you only by your blade, and judge you by your worth. -The Mystery Knight\\n\\n***\\n\\n#Setting the Stage\\n\\nDunk &amp; Egg\\'s arrival to Winterfell is complicated because other books that are released later like \"The Village Hero\" could technically take place before it. So I do not want to speculate too much on when exactly, but we do know several things:\\n\\n**The Ironborn had some early success against the Lannisters and Starks**:\\n\\n&gt;In Dagon\\'s day a weak king sat the Iron Throne, his rheumy eyes fixed across the narrow sea where bastards and exiles plotted rebellion. So forth from Pyke Lord Dagon sailed, to make the Sunset Sea his own. **He bearded the lion in his den and tied the direwolf\\'s tail in knots, but even Dagon could not defeat the dragons**. -ADWD, Victarion I \\n\\n*And if you want to speculate (which I know I said I wasn\\'t going to do lol), this seems like a D&amp;E type scenario where it seems like all hope is lost and then \"Egg uses his boot\" and saves the day.*\\n\\n**Beron Stark died sometime between [212 and 226 AC]**(https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Conquest/Calculations_Ages#Beron_Stark) \\n\\n\\nOutside of Dunk &amp; Egg/Starks, we know the following other characters are in/around Winterfell during this time period:\\n\\n- Old Nan\\n\\n- Lorra Royce (current Lady Stark, Beron\\'s wife) \\n\\nAnd while you can speculate about others, due to the ambiguity about the timing its impossible to say which other characters were there without speculating.\\n\\n***\\n\\nWhile doing this I had to keep in mind that if GRRM decided to push this back from *Dangerous Women* that a lot of the \"facts\" that I am using could have been changed. For instance maybe they aren\\'t all wives of previous LoW, but just Starks in the succession line, which would make more sense unless previous lords were dying quickly and then future lords as well due to the fact that 3 of his sons become LoW.\\n\\n\\n**TLDR: My attempt to gather as much solid information about the \"She Wolves of Winterfell\" before any speculation can begin**',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'We all know the lord of the crossing game Big and Little Walder teach Bran and Rickon while they’re being fostered at Winterfell... \\n\\n&gt;They didn’t have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said “Mayhaps,” so the trick was to say “Mayhaps” so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice. Then you could try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing, but only if you’d said “Mayhaps.” Otherwise you were out of the game. The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he pleased, and he was the only one who got to use a stick.\\n\\n— Bran, ACOK\\n\\n“Mayhaps” was most famously uttered to break an oath by Lord Walder Frey when he welcomed Robb and Caitlyn into the Twins with all the protections afforded under guest right...\\n\\n&gt;Walder Frey’s mouth moved in and out. “Food, heh. A loaf of bread, a bite of cheese, mayhaps a sausage.”  \\n“Some wine to wash it down,” Robb said. “And salt.”  \\n“Bread and salt. Heh. Of course, of course.” The old man clapped his hands together, and servants came into the hall, bearing flagons of wine and trays of bread, cheese, and butter. Lord Walder took a cup of red himself, and raised it high with a spotted hand. “My guests,” he said. “My honored guests. Be welcome beneath my roof, and at my table.”\\n\\n— Cat, ASOS\\n\\nHonored and welcomed. We all know how that turned out, what with the Red Wedding... Guest right and protections abandoned for wholesale slaughter of Robb, his mother Cat, many of his bannermen, as well as much of his army. \\n\\n—//—\\n\\nWelcome to my first series of posts! Moving forward I’ll be examining nearly every use of “mayhaps” throughout the entire ASOIAF series, though to kick things off today we’ll make an exception and examine The World of Ice and Fire first. With that in mind, also note that I’m viewing use of “mayhaps” as a trick of deception generally speaking for the purposes of this series. \\n\\nLet’s begin! \\n\\nSo it looks like the esteemed Maester Yandel who compiled The World of Ice and Fire may well enjoy playing this “mayhaps” deception game as well! Herein follows every single use of “mayhaps” throughout the book - it’s a scant 16  instances, and they do indeed stand out a bit once noted...\\n\\n&gt;This is not to say that the greenseers did not know lost arts that belong to the higher mysteries, such as seeing events at a great distance or communicating across half a realm (as the Valyrians, who came long after them, did). But **mayhaps** some of the feats of the greenseers have more to do with foolish tales than truth. They could not change their forms into those of beasts, as some would have it, but it seems true that they were capable of communicating with animals in a way that we cannot now achieve; it is from this that legends of skinchangers, or beastlings, arose.\\n\\n*Mayhaps* they also never caused the Hammer of the Waters with their magic and it’s perhaps far more likely that a major supernatural catastrophe, such as meteor strikes from the shattered second moon of ancient days, caused the breaking of the Arm of Dorne and even the Long Night, among other possible cataclysmic occurrences to award the end of the Dawn Age! Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;Amongst the houses reduced from royals to vassals we can count the Flints of Breakstone Hill, the Slates of Blackpool, the Umbers of Last Hearth, the Lockes of Oldcastle, the Glovers of Deepwood Motte, the Fishers of the Stony Shore, the Ryders of the Rills\\xa0…\\xa0and **mayhaps** even the Blackwoods of Raventree, whose own family traditions insist they once ruled most of the wolfswood before being driven from their lands by the Kings of Winter (certain runic records support this claim, if Maester Barneby’s translations can be trusted).\\n\\nOh dear... *Mayhaps* the Blackwoods were never the kings of the wolfswood they claim to have been! Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;Later that same year, Lord Tywin Lannister, perhaps unwisely, held a great tournament at Lannisport in honor of Viserys’s birth. **Mayhaps** it was meant to be a gesture toward reconciliation. There the wealth and power of House Lannister was displayed for all the realm to see.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\nPerhaps seeking to gain advantage of His Grace’s high spirits, Lord Tywin chose that very night to suggest that it was past time the king’s heir wed and produced an heir of his own; he proposed his own daughter, Cersei, as wife for the crown prince. Aerys II rejected this proposal brusquely, informing Lord Tywin that he was a good and valuable servant, yet a servant nonetheless. Nor did His Grace agree to appoint Lord Tywin’s son Jaime as squire to Prince Rhaegar; that honor he granted instead to the sons of several of his own favorites, men known to be no friends of House Lannister or the Hand.\\n\\n— TWOIAF, Aerys II\\n\\nReconciliation between Aerys and Tywin huh? *Mayhaps* we all know how this ends up playing out during Robert’s Rebellion. Mayhaps. \\n\\n &gt;{Regarding the foundations under Hightower} If indeed this first fortress is Valyrian, it suggests that the dragonlords came to Westeros thousands of years before they carved out their outpost on Dragonstone, long before the coming of the Andals, or even the First Men. If so, did they come seeking trade? Were they slavers, **mayhaps** seeking after giants? Did they seek to learn the magic of the children of the forest, with their greenseers and their weirwoods? Or was there some darker purpose?  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.\\nThe fused black stone of which it is made suggests Valyria, but the plain, unadorned style of architecture does not, for the dragonlords loved little more than twisting stone into strange, fanciful, and ornate shapes. Within, the narrow, twisting, windowless passages strike many as being tunnels rather than halls; it is very easy to get lost amongst their turnings. **Mayhaps** this is no more than a defensive measure designed to confound attackers, but it too is singularly un-Valyrian. The labyrinthine nature of its interior architecture has led Archmaester Quillion to suggest that the fortress might have been the work of the mazemakers, a mysterious people who left remnants of their vanished civilization upon Lorath in the Shivering Sea. The notion is intriguing but raises more questions than it answers.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\nThe reasons for the abandonment of the fortress and the fate of its builders, whoever they might have been, are likewise lost to us, but at some point we know that Battle Isle and its great stronghold came into the possession of the ancestors of House Hightower. Were they First Men, as most scholars believe today? Or did they **mayhaps** descend from the seafarers and traders who had settled at the top of Whispering Sound in earlier epochs, the men who came before the First Men? We cannot know.\\n\\nA triple usage?! *Mayhaps* it wasn’t the Valyrians seeking giant slaves*! *Mayhaps* the strange architecture has nothing to do with defense! *Mayhaps* it wasn’t even those who came before the First Men who built the fused black stone structures in Westeros at all! Mayhaps. \\n\\n*More on this at the very end with the final use of “Mayhaps”. \\n\\n&gt;It was not their royal blood that made Aegon Targaryen choose to name the Tyrells as Lords of Highgarden, Wardens of the South, and Lords Paramount of the Reach after King Mern IX, the last of the Gardener kings, died, along with all his sons, upon the Field of Fire. Those honors were won by the prudence of Harlan Tyrell, who opened the gates of Highgarden at Aegon’s approach and pledged himself and his family to House Targaryen.  \\nAfterward, a number of the other great houses of the Reach complained bitterly about being made vassals of an “upjumped steward” and insisted that their own blood was far nobler than that of the Tyrells. It cannot be denied that the Oakhearts of Old Oak, the Florents of Brightwater Keep, the Rowans of Goldengrove, the Peakes of Starpike, and the Redwynes of the Arbor all had older and more distinguished lineages than the Tyrells, and closer blood ties to House Gardener as well. Their protests were of no avail, however\\xa0…\\xa0**mayhaps** in part because all these houses had taken up arms against Aegon and his sisters on the Field of Fire, whereas the Tyrells had not.\\n\\nOh my... *Mayhaps* there’s more to say as to why Aegon awarded Highgarden to the lowly stewards of the Tyrells family. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;Storm’s End is surely an old castle, but when compared to the ruined ringforts of the First Men or even the First Keep of Winterfell (which a past maester in service to the Starks examined and found to have been rebuilt so many times that a precise dating could not be made), the great tower and perfectly joined stones of the Storm’s End curtain wall seem much beyond what the First Men were capable of for many thousands of years. The great effort involved in raising the Wall was one thing, but that was more a brute effort than the high art needed to make a wall where even the wind cannot find purchase. Archmaester Vyron, in his Triumphs and Defeats, speculates that the tale’s claim that the final form of Storm’s End was the seventh castle shows a clear Andal influence, and if true, this suggests the possibility that the final form of the castle was only achieved in Andal times. **Mayhaps** the castle was rebuilt on the site of earlier castles, but if so, it was long after Durran Godsgrief and his fair Elenei had passed from this earth.\\n\\nHmm... Andals, huh? Or *mayhaps* it was indeed built by Durran with help from that crafty Bran the Builder! Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;There are no cities in Dorne, though the so-called shadow city that clings to the walls of Sunspear is large enough to be counted as a town (a town built of mud and straw, it must be admitted). Larger and more populous, the Planky Town at the mouth of the river Greenblood is **mayhaps** the nearest thing the Dornish have to a true city, though a city with planks instead of streets, where the houses and halls and shops are made from poleboats, barges, and merchant ships, lashed together with hempen rope and floating on the tide.\\n\\nThis is vexing.... *Mayhaps* the Dornish in fact do have some other city, a secret city, one underground even, maybe more than one, in which to hide entire populations from conquering Targaryen dragon attacks? Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;{Regarding the Breaking of the Arm of Dorne} The single most important event in Dornish history, and **mayhaps** the history of all Westeros, is one about which, to our frustration, we know far too little.  \\nMost of what we do believe of the Breaking comes to us through song and legend. The First Men crossed from Essos to Westeros by land, all agree, walking or riding across through the hills and forest of the great land bridge that connected the two continents in the Dawn Age. Dorne was the first land that they entered, but few remained, as we have chronicled; many and more pressed on northward, through the mountains and **mayhaps** across the salt marshes that once existed where the Sea of Dorne is now. As the centuries passed, they came in ever-increasing numbers, claiming the stormlands and the Reach and the riverlands for their own, eventually reaching even the Vale and the North. They drove the elder races before them, slaughtering giants wherever they found them, hewing down weirwood trees with their bronze axes, making bloody war against the children of the forest.\\n\\nOhhh ho ho doubling up huh...? *Mayhaps* the maesters know an awful lot more about the catastrophe that broke the Arm and flooded what’s now the Sea of Dorne than they let on! As noted above, perhaps it wasn’t the children of the forest and their wacky magic. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;ESSOS, THE VAST continent across the narrow sea, teems with strange, exotic, and ancient civilizations, some still extant and striving, others long fallen and lost to legend. Most of these are far too distant to be of any concern to the people of the Seven Kingdoms, save **mayhaps** for those seafarers bold enough to sail strange waters in search of gold and glory.\\n\\n*Mayhaps* the peoples of the Seven Kingdoms should in fact be far more concerned about these distant lands and kingdoms! That Asshai place seems to be up to no good, that’s for sure. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;Scholars still debate the purpose of these mazes. Were they fortifications, temples, towns? Or did they serve some other, stranger purpose? The mazemakers left no written records, so we shall never know. Their bones tell us that they were massively built and larger than men, though not so large as giants. Some have suggested that **mayhaps** the mazemakers were born of interbreeding between human men and giant women. We do not known why they disappeared, though Lorathi legend suggests they were destroyed by an enemy from the sea: merlings in some versions of the tale, selkies and walrus-men in others.”\\n\\n*Mayhaps* men and giants bangin’ boots?! Where’s Hagrid when ya need him? Perhaps someone should ask Old Nan a little bit more about Hodor. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;The god of Naath is called the Lord of Harmony, oft shown as a laughing giant, bearded and naked, always attended by swarms of slender maidens with butterfly wings. A hundred varieties of butterflies flitter about the island; the Naathi revere them as messengers of the Lord, charged with the protection of his people. **Mayhaps** there is some truth to these legends, for whilst the docile nature of the Naathi seem to make their island ripe for conquest, strangers from beyond the sea do not live long upon the Isle of Butterflies.\\n\\nOh or *mayhaps* the supposedly docile Naathi aren’t so docile and conveniently blame the butterflies. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;Sailors from half a hundred nations have glimpsed these great beasts over the centuries, so **mayhaps** there is some truth behind the tales. Archmaester Margate has suggested that many legends of the north—freezing mists, ice ships, Cannibal Bay, and the like—can be explained as distorted reports of ice-dragon activity. Though an amusing notion, and not without a certain elegance, this remains the purest conjecture. As ice dragons supposedly melt when slain, no actual proof of their existence has ever been found. \\n\\nAh bummer... *Mayhaps* there’s no such thing as ice-dragons after all. Mayhaps. \\n\\n&gt;At the Citadel of Oldtown and other centers of learning in the west, maesters regard these tales of the Great Empire and its fall as legend, not history, yet none doubt that the YiTish civilization is ancient, **mayhap** even contemporary with the realms of the Fisher Queens beside the Silver Sea. In Yi Ti itself, the priests insist that mankind’s first towns and cities arose along the shores of the Jade Sea and dismiss the rival claims of Sarnor and Ghis as the boasts of savages and children.\\n\\nAhhhh or *mayhaps* there’s great truths behind the myths of the Great Empire of the Dawn! It’s well discussed here that they could themselves be the source of the fused black stone structures in Westeros, perhaps even also confused with many of the founding myths among the First Men such as Garth the Greenhand, the Grey King, Barrow King, and more! Mayhaps.\\n\\nWell that’s all of them! Yeah yeah I injected some editorial in there, so sue me. This is all rather fun though... TWOIAF is a 100,000 word book and as said above “mayhaps” is used a scant 16 times. Compare that with similar and synonymous alternative words used : \\n\\n- perhaps - 65 \\n- might / might be - 131 \\n- may - 114\\n- TOTAL - 310\\n\\nThat’s likely not even all the synonyms one could comb for, as there’s contextual phrases that could likely add up also! And well, knowing about the little tricksy game GRRM has established with the Freys and “mayhaps”, instances of 16 vs a minimum of 310 otherwise is quite the lopsided affair. Knowing our author I’d like to think this is very intentional... but who knows, maybe it’s all just a bunch of tinfoil. *Mayhaps*. \\n\\nYou decide!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Once clad in mail or plate, the Lord of Bones seemed to stand a little straighter. He seemed taller too,his shoulders thicker and more powerful than Jon would have thought. It\\'s the armor, not the man , he told himself. \" \\n\\nWe don\\'t know what Dayne looks like but we know he is very strong according to Jaime Lannister. So, what if Mance was already wearing a glamour the whole time he was at the Wall and beyond the Wall. I admit enough people would recognize Arthur Dayne from the Robert\\'s Rebellion time period so I am thinking if Mance is Arthur Dayne a glamour would have to be involved. What if for a split second Jon was able to see what Mance really looks like? Any insights appreciated. Perhaps Melisandre realized this and told Stannis? Could this be why Stannis did not burn Mance? Let me know what you think Please About this topic. Maybe two glamours cancel each other out?',\n",

Lord Darklyn would never have dared defy him if he had been a dragonrider, Aerys reasoned. His attempts to bring forth **dragons from eggs found in the depths of Dragonstone** (some so old that they had turned to stone) yielded naught, however.\\n\\n— TWOIAF, Aerys II\\n\\nThat indicates that an untold number of eggs were still present beneath Dragonstone as recently as Aerys II reign... that is, pretty damned recently! And there’s nothing to indicate that what Aerys attempted destroyed them, nor that they found any and all of them. \\n\\nSo are there more? Are there eggs somewhere in and / or under the Red Keep now, leftovers from Aerys’ attempted hatchings? Are there still yet more unfound in the depths of Dragonstone? \\n\\nDragon eggs galore!

       "   'selftext': \"I know there are a lot of secret Targaryens floating around and its always annoying when a character turns out randomly to be the son of a king, but this is not random. It doesn’t make the story childish wish fulfillment, it makes it painfully ironic, it enhances every arc it affects. I also don’t really believe it will ever be revealed, just a nice piece of poetic irony for the readers to chew on while the characters go about their lives none the wiser. Here are my reasons:\\n\\n**They look like Targaryens.** I may be wrong about this, but I don’t believe that any Lannisters are ever described as being particularly good looking. Certainly not Tywin, I don’t know about Joanna. The only  \\nother people in the books that GRRM describes in the crazy over the top, in your face, omg I’m gonna cream myself because they are so hot way that the Targaryens are talked about are Jaime and Cersei. The very first time we see Jaime it is from Jon Snow’s perspective. Jon, who has never seen the king before, is disappointed at seeing fat King Robert, yet when he sees Jaime, he is impressed. We get a quick description of Jaime physically and then Jon’s first thoughts - among the first sentences ever spoken about him - are, *This is what a king should look like.* And of course, a king of Westeros should look like a Targaryen.\\n\\n**Incest.** This is one of the most oft cited reasons and I do believe this is Martin shoving the similarities in our faces, especially since Cersei defends herself by saying she and Jaime are only doing what the Targaryens did, and she says this about fifty thousand times in the books.\\n\\n**Madness.** Another common argument. The gods flipped a coin, one of them turned out mad and the other didn’t. Don’t Cersei’s chapters feel exactly like what Arys’s chapters would feel like if he had any? Paranoia about plots everywhere, obsession with wildfire. It would definitely be poetic if Cersei were to light the city up with her father’s own caches of wildfire. Besides which, I don’t think madness is (nor are we meant to see it as) a property of incest but rather a property of Targaryens that is enhanced by  \\ninterbreeding. Madness and prophetic visions often go hand in hand in mythology, and I think the Targaryen madness is supposed to be related to dragon dreams.\\n\\n**Jaime murders his father.** Arys tortures Jaime because he believes him to by Tywin's when in reality it is his own son. The poetry of Jaime and Tyrion, half-brothers, each murdering his own father is too good. You can’t tell me you don’t like the sweet, sweet taste of that symmetry. Likewise, that Jaime’s greatest act was not only kingslaying but kinslaying is super cool.\\n\\n**Targaryens are back on the throne.** After all that. *After all that.* Two gigantic wars, thousands dead, the realm torn apart only to reinstate two Targaryens kings while a third is the queen regent. One of those kings and the regent are also likely both possessed of the madness that made Arys intolerable in the first place. Then there is the added irony that the Targaryen hating Robert married a Targaryen, was cuckolded by another, and left his realm to Targaryen children despite all of his efforts to make sure precisely that did not happen.\\n\\n**Of course, Tyrion and Tywin.** This is what’s most important. I hate the idea that Tyrion is a Targaryen because it destroys the defining relationship of Tyrion’s character, that his father hates him. But the poetic irony for both characters if Jaime and Cersei are Targaryens is too much to pass up. Tyrion, already hated by his father, was actually so ugly and deformed that his father actually robbed him of his birthright and gave it to strangers. His arc becomes so much more painful when you consider that. Tywin, absolutely obsessed with his legacy, is so seduced by the beauty of his enemy’s children and so appalled by his own reflection in Tyrion that he spends the entire story robbing his own son in favor of children of a man he hated. And it's almost better from the perspective of Tywin's character. A man who’s entire motivation is to build a legacy spending the entire time thinking he is doing that but is instead tearing it down… It’s too good.\\n\\n**Imagine you are GRRM first writing these characters.** You start out with a few concepts, Hadrian’s Wall, the Sídhe, the War of the Roses. You’ve got to come up with some personalities for your Lancasters. You decide the father is obsessed with his children, his legacy, etc. Like Jaime losing the sword hand that defines him, robbing Tywin of his legacy in poetic fashion just jumps off the page. You’ve got to make some early decisions about grand arcs, and this one seems painfully obvious. This man will fight tooth and nail for his legacy, but his own blindness will lead to its destruction. What else could Tywin’s arc be that would make half – even one tenth! – as much sense. It then follows that there are some children who look great and he favors but are not his, and one who is actually his, but he works to keep his legacy from. All the subsequent decisions made about the characters and their arcs make sense once this first one is made, and they flow so naturally from it.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Tyrion is a controversial character, he starts off as an almost unanimous fan favorite, the sole Lannister we have insight into and who can feign any sort of alignment with our \"protagonists,\" or have any claim to being \"good.\" \\n\\nHis intelligence and status as an outcast due to his disability appeals to our modern sensibilities, and his PoV traverses Westeros and the political landscape, slinging witticisms and sharp jabs along the way, which makes his character an easy one to grasp onto or see oneself in and want to be like.\\n\\nNo wonder he\\'s George\\'s favorite.\\n\\nBut as the series goes on or more so in Dance, the varnish is stripped from his character, in fact, GRRM takes a sledgehammer to it and Tyrion transforms from the loveable \"imp\" (not a positive term) into a misogynist bore on a downward track who\\'s traded places with Bran-pushing Jamie in terms fandom love and endgame predictions.\\n\\nHe\\'s no longer the underdog, he\\'s a rapist (which he is, i\\'m not arguing that) who intends to commit more rape (against Cersei) and a scheming villain, destined to have his tongue ripped out or end the series on the darker side of the spectrum.\\n\\nIn fact, it\\'s not even that he\\'s changed or is in a different place in Dance, it\\'s actually where he always was and we the readers, just missed it.\\n\\nTyrion was actually never or was only mildly disadvantaged, he\\'s a privileged Lannister and harps on his dwarfism too much, a pity party if you will.\\n\\nNot just that, but he\\'s unnaturally misogynistic for his world, doesn\\'t see women as people, and in the eyes of some was culpable in the abuse of Tysha, not a victim of Tywin but an enthusiastic or willing party, at the age of thirteen.\\n\\nIn terms of cruelty? Tywin-lite, how else would you explain his threatening of Tommen or his Symon Silver Tongue Soup and usage of the Mountain Clans, he\\'s \"Tywin writ small\" of course, or \"Tywin\\'s true son,\" as Lady Genna would say, two line\\'s that are meant to be taken at face value apparently.\\n\\nAnd lastly, his final acts on the show, absurd in the eyes of most.\\n\\nHow could Tyrion of all people be given a voice or contribute to the future governance of the continent in a positive manner, as this differ\\'s from all of our discussion and theories and meta\\'s, so of course it has to be the fiction of D&amp;D and a symptom of Saint Tyrion\\'s writing diverging from George\\'s path.\\n\\nMaybe it was supposed to be Jamie in his place, hoisting up the boy he previously pushed (Kingmaker?) in the same way I\\'ve seen it claimed that Theon could have taken Jamie\\'s place in redemption through Bran (despite Theon being heavily tied with Bran in an active fashion in the books, and them both being \"The Prince of Winterfell\") in the final season.\\n\\nAll of this and more are descriptions of prominent narratives I see on Tyrion and the way they\\'ve developed, not without truth of course or reasonable skepticism on the show\\'s part, but narratives I see go unchallenged nonetheless, even though I see plenty of ground too and am lost as to why people wouldn\\'t try to scour the books to find some backing for a book endgame similar in spirit if not acts to that of the show.\\n\\nTo get my thoughts, I actually agree or agreed with a lot of this.\\n\\nI didn\\'t come in to the series a Tyrion fan or \"stan,\" I fell in love with Sansa and Catelyn and Theon and then Jamie.\\n\\nI had no dislike of Tyrion, but his character didn\\'t grab me as he did most, and it wasn\\'t until my second re-read, where something hit for me, and that was the midpoint of ASOS.\\n\\nI was reading a Tyrion chapter, one where he was in an argument with Tywin and made some sort of jape which struck me as remarkably irritating and did the same for Tywin.\\n\\nIt made me think of all of his humor and the way it came across, and suddenly something clicked for me, maybe George was intending readers to be at a wits end with his constant commentary, maybe his positives were flaws and we were supposed to be more critical of Tyrion, maybe by the third book he was more defensive than previously or what prior would have been applauded (like goading Allister Thorne) actually something poised to hurt his position.\\n\\nI didn\\'t turn into one of the people who look at scenes like that and claim \"maybe Tywin has a point about Tyrion\" (which is not only wrong and ignores who Tywin is relative to Tyrion, but just a gross statement to make in my opinion), but suddenly much and more came into place for me, and I began to look back on all thing\\'s Tyrion from his comments on Masha Heddle hanging to the effects his acts had on the smallfolk at points, to his interactions/thought\\'s on sex workers, and felt enlightened.\\n\\nSo come Dance, not only did I welcome where Tyrion was, I loved it and saw it as the logical conclusion of the books to that point, and was right along with the revisionism in the fandom\\'s perspective on Tyrion....until I began to diverge.\\n\\nI think what first occurred, was seeing Theon (my favorite character for a few years, until Tyrion supplanted him over the last two) and Jamie constantly thrown out as George\\'s two greatest accomplishments as a writer, which I could agree with in some way (George has many accomplishments), but as I would see that or Jamie labeled the fan favorite, my mind would drift to Tyrion and I\\'d wonder where his credit was.\\n\\nI mean, he still ranked highly and was the unanimous favorite in the past, but even now isn\\'t his character just as complex, isn\\'t his arc just as stark in change than Jamie/Theon\\'s and just as challenging writing wise?\\n\\nI began to figure that maybe it was just easier to laud praise on a \"redemption\" arc than whatever Tyrion\\'s more steady and dropping arc was.\\n\\nAnd then I would see what I saw as hypocrisy in fandom assessment of characters, Theon fan\\'s who called Tyrion a \"rat\" or claimed he was more intrinsically kind than Tyrion despite probably being more of an asshole, excuses being made for his treatment of women or his rape of Kyra, people gungho on his \"redemption\" (if you can call it that) but seeing Tyrion as doomed.\\n\\nCersei fans irritated at Tyrion and his thoughts towards her/claiming he really meaned to harm her kids or disliking George\\'s apparent preference for one over the other as they relate to her struggles as a woman more, despite their being no law that say\\'s all characters must be treated equally/written with the same intent, which would lead to them ignoring her physical abuse (penis twisting, which Tyrion is aware of, and slapping) and emotional/mental abuse of Tyrion or how she sexually abused Lancel.\\n\\nJamie fans who would excuse his acts or say he hasn\\'t actually done much harm to need to redeem himself more and blasting Tyrion for his response to the Tysha reveal and making absurd claims about their relationship.\\n\\nSandor/Sansa/Sansan fans claiming that Tyrion was especially poor towards her or has less humanity than Sandor which Sandor/Sansa recognize and excusing the way Sandor sexually harassed Sansa and constantly bullied/projected onto her.\\n\\nAnd so much more.\\n\\nIt seemed as though there was a lot of blame to go around/similar traits from characters across the series, even when you get to the more morally upright characters in the political realm like a Catelyn (for how she affected/thought of the smallfolk at points), and it just wasn\\'t being applied equally, I felt as though something was off and maybe in the current political/social justice climate Tyrion and his arc was on the wayside of the current or people were blasting back at what they saw as show missteps/grrm favoritism to the point where they blocked out positive\\'s in the books, or Tyrion\\'s endgame was just set in the minds of many so they only saw what in their game plan.\\n\\nSo I re-read the series again, and I fell in love with Tyrion from the start, I saw every bad thing I saw previously but I saw what lead to it, I saw what traits he shared with others, I saw kindness/empathy and I saw what tempered his worse impulses, I saw alternative explanations for common critiques against him, and I saw someone who may embody George\\'s intent of wading in black and whites and grays to the greatest success (he doesn\\'t to be clear, I think the whole cast does, I just really felt for him more on this specific read).\\n\\nSo what I wanted to do here, was just compile a list of Tyrion meta\\'s/posts that I feel address a majority of these commonly held opinions and offer an alternative explanation for George\\'s intent with his character and where his arc will go and then maybe have a discussion with you all addressing these and what his endgame/George\\'s intent will be.\\n\\n\"The Strings of

       "   'selftext': 'Sansa. TLDR: Jon always says he doesn\\'t want a bastard but he will father one whereas Sansa dreams of a girl that looks like Arya and the only way her dream can be fulfilled is by having a bastard with Jon Snow. \\n\\n&gt; Jon trembled. **“I will never father a bastard,”** he said carefully. “Never!” He spat it out like venom. – JON I AGoT\\n#\\n&gt;Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? ... He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. Where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name. - JON VII AGoT\\n#\\n&gt; “Aye, I’d hope so. A strong son or a lively laughing girl kissed by fire, and where’s the harm in that?”\\nWords failed him for a moment. “The boy … the child would be a bastard.” - JON II ASoS\\n#\\n&gt; \"I will not father a bastard, he told her. I will not. I will not. “You know nothing, Jon Snow,”  - JON VI ASoS\\n#\\n&gt; \"He was a bastard, after all. Everyone knew that bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature, having been born of lust and deceit.\" - JON VIII ASoS\\n\\nI believe George R.R. Martin made Jon repeat that he will not father a bastard because that is exactly what he will end up doing. I also think he fathers a bastard with his cousin Sansa. Why? \\n\\n\\n    In A STORM OF SWORDS Sansa dreams of her children: \\n&gt; She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. If I give him sons, he may come to love me. She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon, and raise them all to be as valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa’s dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. **Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.** - SANSA II ASoS\\n\\nNotice that the girl is only called \\'girl\\' and not \\'daughter\\'. The other children that look like her brothers are called \\'son\\' which makes me think that she will mirror Catelyn in raising true-born Starks and a bastard girl that looks as Northern as Arya. \\n\\nMore importantly. The girl \\'looked like Arya\\' and Arya and Jon look alike so if this girl has to look like Arya, Sansa has to breed (ugly word, I know) with someone that looks like Arya and that is Jon.',\n",

We know that Arianne Martell is going to investigate this potential Targaryen whose claims to the Iron Throne would be strongest if he's not a Blackfyre. \\n\\nNow, Arianne Martell will see Aegon as a threat to the realm and tell Doran that they should ally with Aegon, using herself as a marriage between her and Aegon. Now he has control over the important parts of the Stormlands and Dorne, meaning that the Marcher lords will succumb quickly.\\n\\nAegon is now in a predicament. He's going to have to fight actual powerful enemies, be it Euron in Oldtown, the Tyrells or Ironborn in Highgarden and the center of the Reach, depending on who holds it, the Lannisters in Kings Landing, or any of the people in the North (Bolton, Jon, Stannis). \\n\\nHis next target should be Highgarden, and maybe he doesn't have to kill any large amount of Tyrells and their soldiers as they fought for the Targaryens in Roberts Rebellion. So lets say he takes Highgarden peacefully, he marches on Oldtown and takes it, forcing the Hightowers to bend the knee. \\n\\nHis situation is now very similar to Renly's.

       "   'selftext': 'In *A Clash of Kings*, Jon VII, Jon has his first wolf dream while scouting Mance Rayder’s host in the Frostfangs. Unlike in other wolf dreams he will have later on in the story, Jon experiences some kind of telepathic connection with Bran who was, at the time, hiding from the ironborn in Winterfell’s crypts. All despite being separated by the Wall and by the hundreds of miles between the Frostfangs and Winterfell.\\n\\nI think Jon will have something similar happen to him very early on in *The Winds of Winter*.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nJon’s wolf dream in the Skirling Pass begins like it could have been lifted, verbatim, from any one of several of Bran’s *ACOK* chapters:\\n\\n&gt;When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others. He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness. The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost. His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent. He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound. As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.\\n\\n*ACOK*, Jon VII\\n\\nThen it takes a much stranger turn:\\n\\n&gt;Jon?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too. Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . .  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;A weirwood.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky. Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face. Red eyes looked at him. Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him. The weirwood had his brother\\'s face. Had his brother always had three eyes?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Not always, came the silent shout. Not before the crow.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible. Death, he knew. He was smelling death. He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Don\\'t be afraid, I like it in the dark. No one can see you, but you can see them. But first you have to open your eyes. See? Like this. And the tree reached down and touched him.\\n\\n*ACOK*, Jon VII\\n\\nWe find out later that Jon was not mistaken. Bran actually reached out to Jon and spoke with him:\\n\\n&gt;He remembered who he was all too well; Bran the boy, Bran the broken. Better Bran the beastling. Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams, his wolf dreams? Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened. He could reach Summer whenever he wanted, and **once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon**. Though maybe he had only dreamed that.\\n\\n*ACOK*, Bran VII\\n\\nWhile there are several things we will try to puzzle out about these passages in a moment, at this point we can establish for a certainty that **Bran somehow has the ability to communicate with Jon from a great distance when Jon is warging Ghost**. There are only two other comparable situations in all of *ASOIAF*:\\n\\n1. Bran’s dreams of the three-eyed crow. However, as there is still plenty of debate about who exactly the three-eyed crow is, we should ignore this for now. Whoever the three-eyed crow is, he/she is not a POV character (or at least has not been confirmed as such). This will not be another “who is the three-eyed crow” thread. I promise.\\n2. Daenerys’ visions of Quaithe. We can ignore this as well. It has been speculated that Quaithe is contacting Daenerys via a glass candle, but that has yet to be confirmed in the text. In any case, it has no application to this context.\\n\\nWhat matters for the purpose of this analysis is that we have an example of two POV characters communicating via telepathy, on page, confirmed by both of them in isolation. *Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?*\\n\\nNow that we know this kind of thing is possible, let’s see if we can break down all of the moving parts in order to distill what’s actually happening here before we revisit my assertion that something like this will happen again to Jon in *TWOW*.\\n\\n# Mechanics\\n\\nGRRM prefers to keep the hard-and-fast rules of magic in *ASOIAF* mysterious and somewhat unknowable, so attempting any kind of in-depth analysis of how supernatural forces work in this fantasy world is bound to come up short in one way or another. Nevertheless, at least some semblance of a structure must exist; failing to establish even vaguely discernible limits risks inviting *deus ex machina* accusations, and no writer wants to be accused of cheating. It’s got to make sense.\\n\\nOne pertinent example of a magical “rule” is this quote from Brynden “Bloodraven” Rivers, the last greenseer, the closest thing we have to an authority on our current subject:\\n\\n&gt;\"Only one man in a thousand is born a skinchanger,\" Lord Brynden said one day, after Bran had learned to fly, \"and only one skinchanger in a thousand can be a greenseer.\"\\n\\n*ADWD*, Bran III\\n\\nWe now have a few concrete rules we can work with:\\n\\n* Skinchangers must be born with the gift; an ordinary person cannot learn how to skinchange.\\n* Only skinchangers can be greenseers; if you’re not a skinchanger, forget becoming a greenseer, and if you’re lucky enough to be a skinchanger, your chances of being a greenseer are very, very slim.\\n\\nThis helps us because knowing at least *some* concrete rules exist means we can infer other rules from the text, which will help us determine how Bran was able to reach out to and communicate with Jon over such a great distance. We will be working with the following anecdote of Jon’s dream from *ACOK*, Jon VII, rephrased and spliced with the information we learn from *ACOK*, Bran VII:\\n\\nBran, “*in the chill damp darkness of*” Winterfell’s crypts, with “*his third eye … finally opened … touched Ghost and talked to Jon*” while Jon was skinchanging Ghost in a dream. During the dream, Ghost heard a “*silent shout*” coming from “*a weirwood*” with “*three eyes*” and “*his brother’s face*” that “*seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. The tree was slender ... yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky.*” Ghost “*smelled wolf and tree and boy*,” as well as “*the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and … death*.” Ghost “*cringed back*,” then “*the tree reached down and touched him.*”\\n\\nOkay, that’s a lot to absorb and dissect. Deep breaths. Let’s dig into the first few lines:\\n\\n* Bran, a skinchanger, opened up his “third eye” while hiding in Winterfell’s crypts. Of the confirmed skinchangers we know with POV chapters (Bran, Jon, Varamyr Sixskins), the only one who mentions his third eye is Bran, who is also a greenseer. The implication is that Jon and Varamyr are skinchangers but not greenseers. It follows that only greenseers have the ability to use their third eye.\\n* With his third eye open, Bran “*touched Ghost and talked to Jon*” while Jon was skinchanging Ghost in a dream. Building from our first point, it appears that a greenseer, with his third eye open, can “touch” and communicate with an individual who is skinchanged into an animal. What if Jon had not been skinchanging Ghost? Could Bran still have reached out to him? Well, we do not have any textual evidence of a greenseer telepathically communicating with a conscious skinchanger (or ordinary human, for that matter) who is not at the time skinchanged into an animal. A counterexample might be Theon hearing the heart tree murmur Bran’s name in Winterfell’s godswood (*ADWD*, A Ghost in Winterfell), but we can’t confirm it was communicated to him telepathically and we can’t confirm whether Bran actually tried talking to Theon through the weirwood because, unlike with Jon’s dream in the Frostfangs, we don’t get POV confirmation from Bran. It does not affect our analysis.\\n\\nWe can therefore distill a rule from our analysis of the first part of Jon’s dream: **A greenseer can use his third eye to telepathically communicate with a skinchanger while that skinchanger is skinchanged into an animal.** (Say “skinchanger” one more time, I dare you…)\\n\\nBut wait a minute, what about the weirwood?? Doesn’t that factor into it at all?\\n\\nYou’re right, we have to talk about the weirwood. There’s some *weir*d shit going on with this weirwood. Our rule needs some fine-tuning.\\n\\nLet’s look at the second part of our anecdote and analyze its component parts. This part of the analysis admittedly entails some speculation.\\n\\nWhen Ghost hears Bran’s “silent shout,” it is coming from “*a weirwood*” with “*three eyes*” and “*his brother’s face*” that “*seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. The tree was slender ... yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky.*”\\n\\n* The “silent shout” is Ghost’s animalistic interpretation of a voice inside his head: loud, like a *shout*, as in “easy to interpret,” but *silent*, because Ghost is not receiving the information through his ears. What else would a wolf call a voice in his head? This is analogous to Summer’s interpretation of Winterfell’s walls as “sky-tall man-cliffs” in *ACOK*, Bran I. No more work to do here.\\n* Here’s where the speculation comes in. The weirwood that Ghost approaches looks to be exactly that: a weirwood growing in the wild. However, there appears to be both literal and figurative elements to Ghost’s perception of the weirwood:\\n   * The “slender” weirwood probably is simply a young sapling that is growing “*up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks.*” Weirwoods grow beyond the Wall in larger numbers than anywhere else. While it’s true that weirwoods apparently need a lot of soil and room to grow (thus being unable to take root in the Eyrie’s godswood atop the Giant’s Lance, *AGOT*, Catelyn VII), I still think this is a normal adolescent weirwood. But there’s a few strange things going on here…\\n   * Ghost notes that the weirwood has “*his brother’s face*” but with “*three eyes*.” Ghost also sees the weirwood “*growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky.*” I think Ghost is imagining these aspects of the weirwood for a few reasons: First, we have no textual evidence of a weirwood with three eyes. The third eye is more likely to be imaginary, or projected by Bran, who has just opened his third eye. Second, when Ghost first thinks of his “brother,” he thinks of Summer, not Bran: “*He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees*.” The face that Ghost perceives in the weirwood is more likely Summer’s face, which is how Bran appears in Melisandre’s vision: “*Beside him, a boy with a wolf’s face threw back his head and howled*” (*ADWD*, Melisandre). Bran consistently appearing with a wolf’s face in visions makes sense. Third, Ghost smells “*wolf and tree and boy*.” Ghost is perceiving Summer before Bran, even though Summer is not in the crypts with Bran, because Bran’s projection in visions is that of his wolf. Fourth, Ghost could not have actually watched this weirwood grow so quickly in such a short timespan. My best guess is that, as Ghost perceived the weirwood to have his brother’s face with an extra eye, Ghost also perceived the weirwood as “growing” to reflect the transformation through which Bran has gone and will continue to go as a result of opening his third eye, growing into a more powerful greenseer.\\n\\nSo here we have a wild weirwood growing in the Frostfangs, which Bran has apparently inhabited by reaching out with his third eye. Bran’s occupation of the weirwood causes Ghost, who is being warged by Jon, to perceive the weirwood as something extraordinary. A weirwood in wolf’s clothing, if you will, with an extra eye and a disembodied voice, smelling of Summer.\\n\\nIncorporating this information, we can refine our rule to read: **A greenseer can use his third eye to inhabit a weirwood, which allows him to telepathically communicate with a skinchanger while that skinchanger is skinchanged into an animal.**\\n\\nVery interesting. Okay, just for the sake of the exercise, let’s see if there’s anything else we need to take into account. Now for the final section of the anecdote: Ghost “*smelled wolf and tree and boy*,” as well as “*the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and … death*.” Ghost “*cringed back*,” then “*the tree reached down and touched him.*”\\n\\n* Ghost recognizes the scent of his brother, Summer, as well as the tree, which is right in front of him, and also Bran, who is appearing to Ghost as both Summer and the weirwood. It makes sense that Ghost would smell these things.\\n* Ghost smells earth because Bran and company are hiding in the crypts, which are below the earth. The smell of stone is also obvious: the crypts are a chamber of stone where the Kings of Winter sit their carved stone thrones. Ghost smells death because, well, dead Starks are interred there. Ghost then cringes back, likely because death is not the most pleasant of scents.\\n* Whether the weirwood actually “reached down and touched” Ghost is up for interpretation. We’ve seen the leaves in the Winterfell godswood rustle, but the idea that a tree branch booped Ghost’s snoot seems out of hand. I think it’s much more likely this happened in a magical sense, in the same vein as the weirwood appearing to Ghost with a third eye. Think of it as a kind of telepathic touching, of Bran’s spirit making contact with Ghost’s (and Jon’s) spirit.\\n\\nWhile it adds more depth to Jon’s dream in the Skirling Pass and his connection with Bran during Bran’s time hiding in Winterfell’s crypts, our analysis of the final section of the anecdote doesn’t add anything to our rule.\\n\\nWhew. That was no small effort. We distilled a rule from the text that explains how Bran was able to telepathically communicate with Jon over a ridiculously long distance, even bypassing whatever magical barrier the Wall has going on.\\n\\nWe’ve actually seen something similar to this, except with the mechanics explained from Bran’s perspective. In *ADWD*, Bran III, Bran tries to mentally reach for the weirwood growing through Bloodraven’s cave and ends up looking through the eyes of the weirwood in Winterfell’s godswood. He sees his father as he remembers Lord Eddard, sitting by the edge of the pool cleaning Ice. Leaf explains that Bran “saw what he wished to see,” which was his father and home.\\n\\nIt is a small stretch to suggest that Bran felt the same way about Jon when he was hiding in the crypts. Bran thinks constantly about his brothers and how much he misses them. As yet unskilled and untutored, Bran opened his third eye, thought about Jon and how he was doing and where he might be, and ended up looking through a weirwood close to where Ghost was hunting in the Frostfangs. Since Bran chalked it up to a dream (and because he\\'s like 8), he didn\\'t think about how he was able to do it. Jon, actively skinchanging Ghost at the time, telepathically communicated with Bran through the weirwood. This rather simple explanation using the analog in *ADWD*, Bran II makes the rule derived from our complex textual analysis much more palatable.\\n\\nI don’t see any other way Jon’s dream in the Skirling Pass makes sense. It has been suggested that Bran time-traveled from the future and communicated with Jon from Bloodraven’s cave, just as Bran tried to speak with the deceased Lord Eddard while occupying Winterfell’s heart tree, but too many leaps of logic are required before arriving at that conclusion. First, Bran makes no mention of touching Ghost and talking to Jon while he’s in Bloodraven’s cave. By contrast, it’s *literally right there on the page* in *ACOK*, Bran VII. Second, there is no way Bloodraven’s cave smells more like “*wolf and tree and boy*,” or “*the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and … death*” than Winterfell’s crypts. I\\'m sure those scents exist in Bloodraven\\'s creepy elf cave, but it makes no sense to try to square a circle when the correct answer is staring us in the face. When two POVs, in isolation, separately think about a particular interaction that occurred between those two POVs, the safest bet is that they’re thinking of the exact same interaction.\\n\\nNow that we’ve determined with relative certainty that **a greenseer can use his third eye to inhabit a weirwood, which allows him to telepathically communicate with a skinchanger while that skinchanger is skinchanged into an animal**, it’s time to speculate!\\n\\n# Prediction\\n\\nAfter Jon is stabbed multiple times by Bowen Marsh and company, he will warg into Ghost, who is currently in Castle Black’s armory. Bloodraven, through Mormont’s raven, will telepathically communicate with Jon in much the same way that Jon and Bran communicated in *ACOK*, Jon VII. Before Jon’s body is resurrected, he will be taught to embrace his beastling nature and will learn about his true parentage and destiny.\\n\\nLet’s go over how this will happen piece by piece.\\n\\n**1.**     ***Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.***\\n\\nHopefully you are already familiar with one of the most well-regarded theories on r/asoiaf, which proposes that Jon, after being stabbed at the end of *ADWD*, Jon XIII, will live inside of Ghost until his body is ultimately resurrected. I’m not going to cover the merits here because it’s been around for awhile and this post is already going long. If you are new to this subreddit and have no idea what I’m talking about, reread Melisandre\\'s chapter and the *ADWD* Prologue. The foreshadowing and groundwork is all there. (Who resurrects Jon and how Jon will be resurrected is irrelevant for this discussion.)\\n\\nAssuming Jon is skinchanging Ghost for at least *some* period of time in *TWOW*, GRRM can make one of a few different narrative choices to tell this part of the story. The first and most direct way would be to continue to tell the story from Jon’s perspective while Jon\\'s body is dead and he’s inside Ghost’s head. Another way would be to eliminate, or place on hold, Jon’s POV chapters and tell the story from Melisandre’s POV. Catelyn’s POV was eliminated in such a way, so there is precedent for this narrative decision. Nevertheless, I don’t think it’s very likely that Jon’s POV is eliminated altogether; GRRM has done so much great character work with Jon, and eliminating Jon\\'s POV while keeping him in the story would handicap GRRM\\'s reconstruction of the \"Aragorn\" fantasy hero archetype. And while I do think it’s at least possible that Jon’s POV might be placed on hold until he is ultimately resurrected, I have a feeling GRRM would relish the opportunity to examine Jon’s thoughts about his semi-death, colored through Ghost’s wolfish perspective. So let’s ignore the Melisandre POV scenario and operate under the assumption that Jon will have at least one POV chapter as Ghost.\\n\\nWhen Jon regains consciousness and realizes he’s living his “*second life worthy of a king*” in Ghost, he will be in Castle Black’s armory:\\n\\n&gt;Horse and Rory had replaced Fulk and Mully at the armory door with the change of watch. \"With me,\" Jon told them, when the time came. Ghost would have followed as well, but as the wolf came padding after them, Jon grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and wrestled him back inside. Borroq might be amongst those gathering at the Shieldhall. The last thing he needed just now was his wolf savaging the skinchanger\\'s boar.\\n\\n*ADWD*, Jon XIII\\n\\nGuess who’s there with him?\\n\\n**2.**     ***\"Corn,\" the bird said, and, \"King,\" and, \"Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.\"***\\n\\nAccording to another popular theory, Mormont’s raven—that is, the uncommonly loquacious raven that on the surface functioned as Lord Commander Mormont’s pet, and which now follows Jon around—is occasionally (or constantly) being skinchanged by Bloodraven from his cave north of the Wall. While I don’t recall anyone proffering any hard textual evidence to back this theory up, [Mormont’s raven sure drops an awful lot of interesting hints, many of which even pertain to Jon’s true parentage](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13kena/spoilers_all_mormonts_raven/). It\\'s entirely possible that the raven\\'s dialogue is simply the author winking at us. But skinchanging the Lord Commander’s raven just seems like something Bloodraven would do to keep tabs on the Night’s Watch (and maybe nudge an election in the right way). Most people seem to agree, or can at least admit that it’s more probable than not, so let’s just roll with it and assume this theory is also true for our purposes.\\n\\nWhile we don’t know with 100% certainty that Mormont’s raven is in the armory, it’s where we last see him:\\n\\n&gt;\"Girls,\" squawked Mormont\\'s raven. \"Girls, girls.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;That set Tormund to laughing all over again. \"Now there\\'s a bird with sense. How much do you want for him, Snow? I gave you a son, the least you could do is give me the bloody bird.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"I would,\" said Jon, \"but like as not you\\'d eat him.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Tormund roared at that as well. \"Eat,\" the raven said darkly, flapping its black wings. \"Corn? Corn? Corn?\"\\n\\n*ADWD*, Jon XIII\\n\\nMormont’s raven participates in the above exchange between Jon and Tormund, which occurs moments before Jon receives the Pink Letter from Clydas. Mormont’s raven isn’t mentioned again for the remainder of the chapter. Jon doesn’t make note of the raven when he’s leaving the armory, nor when he arrives in the Shieldhall, nor during his speech, nor when he’s leaving the Shieldhall. The raven is conspicuous in its absence when Jon finds Wun Wun ragdolling Ser Patrek.\\n\\nWhile it’s plausible Mormont’s raven went and fucked off somewhere else off page, it would be very uncharacteristic of this bird to miss a major Castle Black event like the assassination of the Lord Commander.\\n\\nGRRM intentionally kept Mormont’s raven in the armory so that a greenseer can act as a mystical guide for Jon in the same way the three-eyed crow is for Bran and Quaithe is for Daenerys. And it will establish a telepathic greenseer-to-skinchanger connection in (almost) the same way Bran reached out to Jon in the Frostfangs, using the formula we developed above.\\n\\n**3.     Hold on, don’t we need a weirwood?**\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\nBut maybe not.\\n\\n&gt;\"It was the singers who taught the First Men to send messages by raven … but in those days, the birds would speak the words. The trees remember, but men forget, and so now they write the messages on parchment and tie them round the feet of birds who have never shared their skin.\"\\n\\n*ADWD*, Bran III\\n\\nHow would the birds speak the words? We can assume they didn\\'t squawk at each other. The implication is that two skinchangers warged the same bird, then conversed as men or singers normally do, but telepathically. Since this is our best guess, Mormont\\'s raven would simply need to land on Ghost\\'s back so Bloodraven can skinchange Ghost and tell Jon all he needs to know.\\n\\nIf a weirwood actually *is* needed, Mormont\\'s raven need only scream \"Tree!\" at Ghost until Jon gets it, then bolt out the front door of the armory the second someone opens it. Wild weirwoods still grow in the North.\\n\\nIn fact, Mormont’s raven has been trying to talk to Jon during his wolf dreams since Jon’s first chapter in *ADWD*:\\n\\n&gt;\"Snow,\" the moon insisted.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath frosting in the air. On starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream. The wolf\\'s pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out. On the other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed. That was where his brother was, the grey brother who smelled of summer.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Snow.\" An icicle tumbled from a branch. The white wolf turned and bared his teeth. \"Snow!\" His fur rose bristling, as the woods dissolved around him. \"Snow, snow, snow!\" He heard the beat of wings. Through the gloom a raven flew.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;It landed on Jon Snow\\'s chest with a thump and a scrabbling of claws. \"SNOW!\" it screamed into his face.\\n\\n*ADWD*, Jon I\\n\\nBut he can never catch Jon during his wolf dreams; Jon is \"*untaught, still fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it.*\" *ADWD*, Prologue.\\n\\nI think Bloodraven has something pressing to tell Jon...\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\n... but we can\\'t be sure what it is, so I\\'m going to end this theory by suggesting that Bloodraven will tell Jon what Bloodraven wants Jon to know, not what we want Jon to know. There has been a ton of speculation regarding Bloodraven\\'s motivations, but I won\\'t be digging into that here. At the very least, he seems to want to defeat the threat of the Others, but he also seems to want a Targaryen back on the Iron Throne, if that raven\\'s squawking is any indication. My best guess is that he sees Jon as the last scion of House Targaryen, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Bloodraven is the first to suggest to Jon that his death means his watch has ended and he is no longer bound to the Wall.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s clear Jon wanted to march against the Boltons before he was murdered, it\\'s unclear exactly what Jon thought would occur afterward. If he was victorious, would he simply waltz back up to the Wall and resume his duties as Lord Commander? He might be hesitant. Jon is not stupid. He knows going to war with the *de jure* Warden of the North makes him an oathbreaker in the eyes of more than a few. But with Bloodraven whispering in his ear, Jon may decide that rapid political consolidation of the North is the optimal strategy for dealing with the coming threat of the Others.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR After Jon\\'s murder, Jon will warg into Ghost and communicate with Bloodraven through Mormont’s raven the same way that Jon and Bran communicated in** ***ACOK*****, Jon VII. Before Jon’s body is resurrected, he will be taught to embrace his beastling nature and will learn about his true parentage and destiny.**',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI realized something when I was thinking about the Dance of Dragons 2. It is not wrong to expect some similarities between the first war and the second war. So we can expect some characters to resemble the roles of other characters.\\n\\nIn this topic, I will tell you which (in the first Dance) character will coincide with Jorah in the second Dance. Of course I can\\'t claim that it is 100%.\\n\\nLet\\'s start.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n&gt;**Dany** found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark **green**, embroidered with the likeness of a **black** bear standing on two legs.\\n\\nThat was Dany\\'s first encounter with Jorah. He then stood close to the girl and sent everything that had happened to Varys in exchange for a pardon. Over time, Jorah continued to report to Varys, even in the city of Qarth, although he tried to protect her because he loved her. He had stopped after that, but it was a painful betrayal for Dany. She banished Jorah and decided that he was one of the three betrayals (love) she was supposed to see at the house of the Undying.\\n\\nYou decide if Jorah\\'s betrayal is one of love, gold, or blood betrayal, but I will approach it in a different way.\\n\\nThe prophecy foretells the future, does not tell the past. It is important that this action began to take place before the warnings, even though Dany had heard after about the spying activities of Jorah. So, just as we cannot accept Mirri\\'s action as being carried out in three betrayals, we cannot accept Jorah\\'s betrayal either. Mirri\\'s and Jorah\\'s actions took place in parallel with each other, and Dany became aware of one\\'s action long after the other\\'s action, that\\'s all. We cannot see it as a betrayal of love. Do not forget that the Immortals said what will happens, not the ones that what happened. So it is necessary to look at what is in the future, not the past.\\n\\nJorah being a spy is not one of those betrayals, but Jorah will still commit a betrayal. A betrayal from him may indeed be a betrayal of “love.. We usually expected to see a betrayal from the person Dany would fall in love with, or that is still could be true; This betrayal may come from someone she is in love with (Daario) or someone who loves her. When Jorah said, \"I love you,\" Dany thought it was \"love betrayal.\" As a matter of fact, the possibility of betrayal not only that Dany is in love with someone, also someone who is in love with her should be taken into consideration. Let\\'s leave this part for now and step by step.\\n\\n* **Jorah, is he capable of betraying Dany?**\\n\\nAfter reading Jorah\\'s hopes of returning to Dany after falling in love and after exile, we assumed that this man would stay with her until the end. Because it displayed an image of unshakable loyalty. Of course I still think so, but when I read the book Fire and Blood, I noticed a serious threat along with what I noticed. Well, I questioned him. Therefore, I think that the probability of betrayal is almost close to each other if it remains true to the end. At least for me - for now - 50% / 50% A move from the most unexpected person already matches the GRRM\\'s style of writing. Remember that Jorah kept spying on her when she was in love. Knowing this is a betrayal. Why? For home. Jorah is someone who can betray Dany for \"home\". We saw this. He already did that. In the future, Jorah\\'s heart can be split into two for both home and Dany.\\n\\nWhy do I think Jorah can betray?\\n\\n1. **Green Jinx**\\n\\nWe know green color is a sign of bad luck(and enemy or something like that) for Dany. In the first dance, the two sides were divided as black and greens. The second dance could be the same. (Black Drogon and Green Rhaegal)\\n\\nThe floor of Xaro\\'s private apartment was made of green marble, which wanted one of Dany\\'s dragons, and moreover, he clearly showed hostility. Kraznys\\'s dress was green. Cleon send her green slipper. After what happened in Qarth, they sent an insect to assassinate Dany; There was a green stone in the box and the insect was green. They wanted to poison her with locus in Meereen. (Locus are usually green.) Galazza Galare , Green Grace(I believe she is Hyperia, also she has green eyes and wears green dress). Rhaegal dragon in green color. He killed Quentyn and possibly brought the end of the Dorne alliance (Quhuru Mo seem to have no a bad influence for now despite wearing a green cloak, but looking at the last two books we should comment. He appeared twice; I say we will see more).\\n\\nNow let\\'s come to another character that is described with green color; Jorah Mormont.\\n\\nHis family sigil is a **black** bear on top of **green** background. He walks around in a green cloak or clothes that has family colors. That\\'s why it\\'s quite possible for him to bring a jinx to Dany (Of course he did something bad to Dany in the first place. But we expect much greater betrayal. Something so important that Undying have to warn Dany).\\n\\n2. **Warning of the Undying**\\n\\nThe Undying Ones said Dany would see betrayals . They warned her because these betrayals will be as have been too heavy, too jarring, touchstone in the future. Otherwise, minor betrayals will only annoy you. but great betrays means great losses. The betrayals of highly trusted people will undoubtedly be overwhelming.\\n\\nWhen she found out that Jorah was a spy, Dany was hurt and of course left a mark on her. However, his appearance as a spy was not a devastating betrayal of Dany\\'s life.\\n\\nOtherwise, Dany wouldn\\'t be willing to forgive him. If Jorah had spoken more humbly, Dany would have wanted to forgive him, but he didn\\'t do it, and only made her more angry.\\n\\n&gt;\"No . . . no.\" He shook his head. \"I never meant . . . forgive me. You have to forgive me.\"  \\n\"Have to?\" It was too late. He should have begun by begging forgiveness. She could not pardon him as she\\'d intended.\\n\\nIf Jorah makes a betrayal in the future. More than a simple spyin thing betrayal ... This is something that Dany will never forgive, and moreover, that brings great destruction to her. Because the most destructive betrayal, the most unexpected; is the closest one. Jorah suits such betrayal.\\n\\n**3. Dance Of Dragons 1th. - Criston Cole**\\n\\nHere\\'s the real reason for me to believe that Jorah will change his sides... Criston Cole.\\n\\n&gt;Ser Criston Cole was a knight from House Cole. Made a member of King Viserys I Targaryen\\'s Kingsguard, eventually rising to Lord Commander. Criston convinced Viserys\\'s son, Aegon, to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms as his father lay dead. This led to the Dance of the Dragons, a civil war between Aegon II and his elder sister, Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his successor. For this he became known as Criston the Kingmaker.  \\nIn 112 AC Ser Criston was still Rhaenyra\\'s champion and constant companion. Lord Commander Ser Harrold Westerling died in that year, and Criston was named his successor to lead the White Cloaks. It was rumored that Cole had an affair with Rhaenyra in 113 AC. - ASOIAF WİKİ\\n\\nIn the first place Cole was on the side of the blacks party. I believe the rumor that he is in love with the princess is true. Nobody has any doubts about that, I guess? Whatever happened between them, Cole became hostile to the princess. Cole switched his sides and passed to the greens party.\\n\\nIn fact, there were signs. Let\\'s look his physical appearance.\\n\\n&gt;Criston had coal **black** hair and pale **green** eyes.\\n\\nI think his black hair is some sort of FS that would be on his first Rae(blacks) side and his green eyes on his greens. Colors are important in Dance.\\n\\n* **So, What about Jorah Mormont?**\\n\\n&gt;Jorah was lord of Bear Island. Jorah showed courage during Greyjoy\\'s Rebellion, being one of the first men through the breach during the siege of Pyke. He received knighthood from King Robert I Baratheon in recognition of his bravery. During a tourney at Lannisport to celebrate the victory over the Greyjoy rebels, Jorah met Lynesse Hightower and fell in love. He asked for her favor to wear during the tournament, for which she gave her permission and became champion. Jorah and Lynesse were married at Lannisport. -ASOIAF Wiki\\n\\nWe know Lynesse look like Dany. Jorah and his wife did not have a happy marriage, and she betrayed him. Since then, Jorah hates as much as he loves his wife. ***Like Cole.***\\n\\n&gt;She gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question. \"What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?\"  \\nSer Jorah smiled sadly. \"**Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys**.\" He bowed low. \"Sleep well, my queen.\"  \\nDany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. She looked like me. It explained much that she had not truly understood. He wants me, she realized. **He loves me as he loved her,** not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman.\\n\\nGuess it looks like Jorah\\'s love for Dany comes from his likeness to his own wife.\\n\\nThings like Jorah and Cole falling in love with the Targaryen girls and being rejected, both being champions in a tournament, have been similar to now. In addition, Jorah was Dany\\'s sworn shield at first, and then the first of the queen guards, even the Lord Commander(when he was first-and only- queensguard, it made him also lord commander, i guess), like Cole.\\n\\n&gt;Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard . . . and when Mormont\\'s gruff counsel and the omens agreed, her course was clear.\\n\\nCole\\'s eye and hair color was a sign that he would be on both sides. Remember, Jorah\\'s family sigil is a **black** bear on top of **green** background and he wears green clothes. (The Asoiaf wiki says he has a black beard, but I\\'ve never seen it write in books.)\\n\\n*So, Jorah will be side the first blacks in this battle. He\\'s in love with Dany and wants to stand by her. But then something will happen, and Jorah will be hostile to Dany and will be side the greens.*\\n\\n* **Causes of Betrayal**\\n\\nMany scenarios can be produced for this. Like Cole, Dany didn\\'t answer Jorah\\'s love, but I don\\'t give that much chance because I think he already knows Dany never lover him like that, he is not stupid. Even though he was exiled, he still strives to be with her.\\n\\nThe possibility in my mind is \"home\" and \"family\".\\n\\nJorah has a home wound as much as a love wound. He told her this much. Even Dany wondered.\\n\\n&gt;\"I am going to take you **home** one day, Missandei,\" Dany promised. If I had made the same promise to **Jorah**, would he still have sold me? \"I swear it.\"\\n\\nWe know Dany will be corrupt by power. We also know that her actions will be a bit extreme. Dany\\'s revenge list also includes the north. I believe she could turn into a Maegor-Viserys mix.\\n\\n&gt;She lifted her head. \"And I am Daenerys Stormborn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and **Maegor the Cruel** and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\\'s daughter, and I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\"\\n\\nI believe it is a FS. Dany became Aegon the Conqueror, she was Aegon the Conqueror with teats. Later she will became Maegor the Cruel with teats. Rae was even called by that name when she took KL.\\n\\nSo, Her actions may become unacceptable to Jorah after some point. Especially if Dany starts posing a threat to his family ...his home... Jorah can change sides for this reason. After all, everyone has a limit. Even if Jorah is in love with her, he\\'s not going to trade his family\\'s life and home for her.\\n\\nI hate to refer to the show as a reference, but for example ... Jon was in love with her but he killed her anyway because to save his family and home. Why shouldn\\'t Jorah change sides?\\n\\nIn short, the “love” of the three betrayals seems to be very suitable for Jorah. What do you say?\\n\\nThank you for read and sorry again my bad English.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '##Intro\\n\\nOn our most recent [NotACast episode covering ACOK, Jon III](https://notacastasoiaf.podbean.com/e/episode-95-a-clash-of-kings-jon-iii-winter-knights/), we finally arrived at Craster\\'s Keep. Once a while, we come across aspects (mostly #Catches) that I\\'ll try to share here, and I figure now was as good of a time as ever to talk about a pretty interesting catch on how Craster lied about not seeing Benjen Stark.\\n\\nFirst, check out some of /u/JoeMagician\\'s posts about Craster -- whether it\\'s the OG [\"A Cold Death in the Snow\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3ol77p/spoilers_all_spoilers_all_a_cold_death_in_the/) or [\"The Secrets of Craster\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3fh384/spoilers_all_the_secrets_of_craster/). There\\'s a lot subtlety that GRRM integrates into the story of Craster about the axe, his relationship to the Others, etc.\\n\\nFor our purposes today, we\\'re just going to explore Craster\\'s relationship to Benjen Stark, and some proof of how he lied to Jeor Mormont about the last time he saw Benjen Stark.\\n\\nBut let\\'s set the scene first before the reveal.\\n***\\n##The Setting\\n\\nMormont sets north of the Wall with a great ranging in an effort to track down Benjen Stark and figure out what Mance Rayder is up to. After moving through abandoned villages north of the Wall, the ranging comes onto the non-abandoned Craster\\'s Keep. This compound was a place of refuge for Night\\'s Watchmen ranging north. Mormont and the Night\\'s Watc high command enter into Craster\\'s \"house\" to ask after Benjen and Mance Rayder.\\n\\nEventually, Jon is asked in, and as he comes in, Jon overhears Craster talking about Benjen Stark:\\n\\n&gt; \"I\\'ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years,\" he was telling Mormont. \"And if truth be told, I never once missed him.\" (ACOK, Jon III)\\n\\nThis strikes the watchmen as odd given that Craster was the singular location where rangers went to as a waypoint before proceeding on with the rest of their mission to the north. And Thoren Smallwood and Jeor Mormont state as much:\\n\\n&gt; “He ought to have passed here last year,” said Thoren Smallwood. A dog came sniffing round his leg. He kicked it and sent it off yipping.\\n\\n&gt; Lord Mormont said, “Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, who’d vanished with Gared and young Will.”\\n\\nBut what Craster says next shows that Craster lied about not seeing Benjen Stark.\\n***\\n##Craster\\'s Lie\\n\\nLet\\'s do Craster\\'s response in full:\\n\\n&gt; “Aye, those three I recall. The lordling no older than one of these pups. Too proud to sleep under my roof, him in his sable cloak and black steel. My wives give him big cow eyes all the same.” He turned his squint on the nearest of the women. “Gared says they were chasing raiders. I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch ’em. Gared wasn’t half-bad, for a crow. Had less ears than me, that one. The ’bite took ’em, same as mine.” Craster laughed. “Now I hear he got no head neither. The ’bite do that too?”\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s talk about the omission. Craster completely ignores the questions Mormont and Smallwood have -- asking why Benjen never showed up here given this is where Benjen *should* have come. And then he starts rambling about Waymar Royce, Gared and Will for a while.\\n\\n**But it\\'s in those ramblings, Craster accidentally tells everyone that he saw Benjen Stark quite recently.**\\n***\\n##The Investigation\\n\\nSo, let\\'s get into what Craster says. He talks about Waymar, his clothing and attire and how he didn\\'t like how his daughter-wives were giving him \"cow eyes\". He didn\\'t like Waymar Royce. Will gets ignored altogether. But then we get to Gared. \\n\\nGared, if you\\'ll recall, was the one survivor of the AGOT, Prologue. Sadly for Gared, sadly for the realm, Gared was captured south of the Wall and executed by Ned Stark in AGOT, Bran I. And it\\'s that piece of information, that this gets interesting!\\n\\nAs we know from AGOT, Lord Commander Mormont didn\\'t find out about Gared\\'s death until his head was sent from Winterfell:\\n\\n&gt; Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall,\" he went on, \"yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell.\" (AGOT, Tyrion III)\\n\\nNow, this is supposition, but I think it makes sense given what we know next. I think it\\'s likely that Ned sent Gared\\'s head went back with Benjen, Jon and Tyrion. This chronological point is important, because **the next ranging that went north from Winterfell after Jon arrives at the Wall is Benjen\\'s ranging with Othor and Jafer Flowers.**\\n\\nSo, Gared\\'s head arrives back at the Wall (likely with Benjen), then Benjen heads north of the Wall on a ranging in Jon\\'s third chapter in AGOT. \\n\\nYou\\'re probably asking why this matters, and here it is: **Craster couldn\\'t have known that Gared was beheaded unless Benjen Stark and his rangers told him about it.** Remember, no one knew at Castle Black that Gared was beheaded until Gared\\'s head arrived back. So, any rangings north of the Wall between Gared\\'s execution and Benjen\\'s ranging likely wouldn\\'t have arrived at Craster\\'s Keep with this information.\\n\\nBut Craster says:\\n\\n&gt; Gared wasn’t half-bad, for a crow. Had less ears than me, that one. The ’bite took ’em, same as mine.” Craster laughed. **“Now I hear he got no head neither. The ’bite do that too?”**\\n\\nHow in the world did Craster find out about this unless Benjen told him?\\n***\\n##Conclusion: Benjen Told Craster About Gared, and Craster Lied to Mormont\\n\\nSo, Craster likely knew about Gared\\'s fate from Benjen Stark, and this means that Craster lied to Mormont about seeing Benjen. But why? \\n\\n&gt; \"[Craster] gives the boys to the gods. Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often. That\\'s why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the sheep\\'s gone too. Next it will be dogs, till . . .\" (ACOK, Jon III)\\n\\nI think it\\'s likely that Craster let the Others know about the ranging, and maybe dropped the additional bit of information that a Stark was among the rangers. Perhaps, Craster attempted to leverage this information into buying off the Others from taking his sheep.\\n\\nAll the same, we know that Benjen\\'s companions Othor and Jafer Flowers had an encounter with the Others, turning up as wights south of the Wall in AGOT, Jon VII. Benjen Stark remains missing though. So, it\\'s unclear whether the Others have Benjen or he\\'s still on the loose.\\n\\nBut Benjen Stark was present at Craster\\'s Keep, and Craster lied about this. And somewhere out in the Haunted Forest, Benjen remains.',\n",

Would you have me fight the Crow\\'s Eye?

Stop clutching me, woman.\" King Stannis put a hand on her shoulder, awkwardly untangling himself from her grasp. \"Perhaps Robert did curse our marriage bed. He swore to me that he never meant to shame me, that he was drunk and never knew which bedchamber he entered that night. But does it matter? The boy was not at fault, whatever the truth.\"\\n\\n&gt;Melisandre put her hand on the king\\'s arm. \"**The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious.

Then, very softly, he said, **\"I dream of it sometimes. Of Renly\\'s dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood.\" Stannis looked down at his hands. \"I was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried to wake me. Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting, fretting. I should have been ahorse, armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean.\"** \\n\\n&gt;Ser Davos Seaworth could feel his phantom fingertips start to itch.

They had spent most of it out on the ice, shivering beside a pair of holes they\\'d cut in the smaller of the frozen lakes, with fishing lines clutched in mitten-clumsy hands. Not long ago, they could count on hooking one or two fish apiece, and wolfswood men more practiced at ice-fishing were pulling up four or five. **Today all that Asha had come back with was a chill that went bone deep**. Aly had fared no better. It had been three days since either of them had caught a fish. -ADWD, The Sacrifice\\n\\n\\n&gt;\"Wise. I am sorry for your mother, but I do not spare the lives of turncloaks. This one, especially. He slew two sons of Eddard Stark. Every northman in my service would abandon me if I showed him any clemency. Your brother must die.\"\\n\\n&gt;**\"Then do the deed yourself, Your Grace.\" The chill in Asha\\'s voice made Theon shiver in his chains. \"Take him out across the lake to the islet where the weirwood grows, and strike his head off with that sorcerous sword you bear. That is how Eddard Stark would have done it. Theon slew Lord Eddard\\'s sons. Give him to Lord Eddard\\'s gods. The old gods of the north. Give him to the tree.\"**\\n \\n&gt;And suddenly there came a wild thumping, as the maester\\'s ravens hopped and flapped inside their cages, their black feathers flying as they beat against the bars with loud and raucous caws. \"The tree,\" one squawked, \"the tree, the tree,\" whilst the second screamed only, \"Theon, Theon, Theon.\" -TWOW, Theon I\\n\\n***\\n\\nI don\\'t know where I want to take it from here or how it fits in with any theories that I believe yet (beginning of Nightlamp or Waking the Stone Dragon) or others I am insure about (Theon Latecomer), but I liked how this fit together.\\n\\nLet me know your thoughts or if it fits/doesn\\'t fit with any of your favorite theories.\\n\\n**TLDR: If/when Stannis takes Theon out before the heart tree, the trees (who have eyes again) and the men will see the accursed man (who killed Renly).**',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello,\\n\\nI realized something when I was thinking about the Dance of Dragons 2. It is not wrong to expect some similarities between the first war and the second war. So we can expect some characters to resemble the roles of other characters.\\n\\nIn this topic, I will tell you which (in the first Dance) character will coincide with Jorah in the second Dance. Of course I can\\'t claim that it is 100%.\\n\\nLet\\'s start.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;**Dany** found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark **green**, embroidered with the likeness of a **black** bear standing on two legs.\\n\\nThat was Dany\\'s first encounter with Jorah. He then stood close to the girl and sent everything that had happened to Varys in exchange for a pardon. Over time, Jorah continued to report to Varys, even in the city of Qarth, although he tried to protect her because he loved her. He had stopped after that, but it was a painful betrayal for Dany. She banished Jorah and decided that he was one of the three betrayals (love) she was supposed to see at the house of the Undying.\\n\\nYou decide if Jorah\\'s betrayal is one of love, gold, or blood betrayal, but I will approach it in a different way.\\n\\nThe prophecy foretells the future, does not tell the past. It is important that this action began to take place before the warnings, even though Dany had heard after about the spying activities of Jorah. So, just as we cannot accept Mirri\\'s action as being carried out in three betrayals, we cannot accept Jorah\\'s betrayal either. Mirri\\'s and Jorah\\'s actions took place in parallel with each other, and Dany became aware of one\\'s action long after the other\\'s action, that\\'s all. We cannot see it as a betrayal of love. Do not forget that the Immortals said what will happens, not the ones that what happened. So it is necessary to look at what is in the future, not the past.\\n\\nJorah being a spy is not one of those betrayals, but Jorah will still commit a betrayal. A betrayal from him may indeed be a betrayal of “love.. We usually expected to see a betrayal from the person Dany would fall in love with, or that is still could be true; This betrayal may come from someone she is in love with (Daario) or someone who loves her. When Jorah said, \"I love you,\" Dany thought it was \"love betrayal.\" As a matter of fact, the possibility of betrayal not only that Dany is in love with someone, also someone who is in love with her should be taken into consideration. Let\\'s leave this part for now and step by step.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Jorah, is he capable of betraying Dany?**\\n\\nAfter reading Jorah\\'s hopes of returning to Dany after falling in love and after exile, we assumed that this man would stay with her until the end. Because it displayed an image of unshakable loyalty. Of course I still think so, but when I read the book Fire and Blood, I noticed a serious threat along with what I noticed. Well, I questioned him. Therefore, I think that the probability of betrayal is almost close to each other if it remains true to the end. At least for me - for now - 50% / 50% A move from the most unexpected person already matches the GRRM\\'s style of writing. Remember that Jorah kept spying on her when she was in love. Knowing this is a betrayal. Why? For home. Jorah is someone who can betray Dany for \"home\". We saw this. He already did that. In the future, Jorah\\'s heart can be split into two for both home and Dany.\\n\\nWhy do I think Jorah can betray?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Green Jinx**\\n\\nWe know green color is a sign of bad luck(and enemy or something like that) for Dany. In the first dance, the two sides were divided as black and greens. The second dance could be the same. (Black Drogon and Green Rhaegal)\\n\\nThe floor of Xaro\\'s private apartment was made of green marble, which wanted one of Dany\\'s dragons, and moreover, he clearly showed hostility.  Kraznys\\'s dress was green. Cleon send her green slipper. After what happened in Qarth, they sent an insect to assassinate Dany; There was a green stone in the box and the insect was green. They wanted to poison her with locus in Meereen. (Locus are usually green.)  Galazza Galare , Green Grace(I believe she is  Hyperia, also she has green eyes and wears green dress). Rhaegal dragon in green color. He killed Quentyn and possibly brought the end of the Dorne alliance (Quhuru Mo seem to have no a bad influence for now despite wearing a green cloak, but looking at the last two books we should comment. He appeared twice; I say we will see more).\\n\\nNow let\\'s come to another character that is described with green color; Jorah Mormont.\\n\\nHis family sigil is a **black** bear on top of **green** background. He walks around in a green cloak or clothes that has family colors. That\\'s why it\\'s quite possible for him to bring a jinx to Dany (Of course he did something bad to Dany in the first place. But we expect much greater betrayal. Something so important that Undying have to warn Dany).\\n\\n2. **Warning of the  Undying**\\n\\nThe Undying Ones said Dany would see betrayals . They warned her because these betrayals will be as have been too heavy, too jarring, touchstone  in the future. Otherwise, minor betrayals will only annoy you. but great betrays means great losses. The betrayals of highly trusted people will undoubtedly be overwhelming.\\n\\nWhen she found out that Jorah was a spy, Dany was hurt and of course left a mark on her. However, his appearance as a spy was not a devastating betrayal of Dany\\'s life.\\n\\nOtherwise, Dany wouldn\\'t be willing to forgive him. If Jorah had spoken more humbly, Dany would have wanted to forgive him, but he didn\\'t do it, and only made her more angry. \\n\\n \\n\\n&gt;\"No . . . no.\" He shook his head. \"I never meant . . . forgive me. You have to forgive me.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Have to?\" It was too late. He should have begun by begging forgiveness. She could not pardon him as she\\'d intended. \\n\\nIf Jorah makes a betrayal in the future. More than a simple spyin thing betrayal ... This is something that Dany will never forgive, and moreover, that brings great destruction to her. Because the most destructive betrayal, the most unexpected; is the closest one. Jorah suits such betrayal.\\n\\n**3. Dance Of Dragons 1th. -  Criston Cole** \\n\\nHere\\'s the real reason for me to believe that Jorah will change his sides... Criston Cole.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Ser Criston Cole was a knight from House Cole. Made a member of King Viserys I Targaryen\\'s Kingsguard, eventually rising to Lord Commander. Criston convinced Viserys\\'s son, Aegon, to claim the rule of the Seven Kingdoms as his father lay dead. This led to the Dance of the Dragons, a civil war between Aegon II and his elder sister, Rhaenyra, whom Viserys had long groomed as his successor. For this he became known as Criston the Kingmaker.   \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;In 112 AC Ser Criston was still Rhaenyra\\'s champion and constant companion. Lord Commander Ser Harrold Westerling died in that year, and Criston was named his successor to lead the White Cloaks. It was rumored that Cole had an affair with Rhaenyra in 113 AC. - ASOIAF WİKİ\\n\\nIn the first place Cole was on the side of the blacks party. I believe the rumor that he is in love with the princess is true. Nobody has any doubts about that, I guess? Whatever happened between them, Cole became hostile to the princess. Cole switched his sides and passed to the greens party.\\n\\nIn fact, there were signs. Let\\'s look his physical appearance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Criston had coal **black** hair and pale **green** eyes.  \\n\\nI think his black hair is some sort of FS that would be on his first Rae(blacks) side and his green eyes on his greens. Colors are important in Dance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **So, What about Jorah Mormont?**\\n\\n&gt;Jorah was lord of Bear Island. Jorah showed courage during Greyjoy\\'s Rebellion, being one of the first men through the breach during the siege of Pyke. He received knighthood from King Robert I Baratheon in recognition of his bravery. During a tourney at Lannisport to celebrate the victory over the Greyjoy rebels, Jorah met Lynesse Hightower and fell in love.  He asked for her favor to wear during the tournament, for which she gave her permission and became champion. Jorah and Lynesse were married at Lannisport. -ASOIAF Wiki\\n\\nWe know Lynesse look like Dany. Jorah and his wife did not have a happy marriage, and she betrayed him. Since then, Jorah hates as much as he loves his wife. ***Like Cole.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;She gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question. \"What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Ser Jorah smiled sadly. \"**Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys**.\" He bowed low. \"Sleep well, my queen.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Dany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. She looked like me. It explained much that she had not truly understood. He wants me, she realized. **He loves me as he loved her,** not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman. \\n\\nGuess it looks like Jorah\\'s love for Dany comes from his likeness to his own wife.\\n\\nThings like Jorah and Cole falling in love with the Targaryen girls and being rejected, both being champions in a tournament, have been similar to now. In addition, Jorah was Dany\\'s sworn shield at first, and then the first of the queen guards, even the Lord Commander(when he was first-and only- queensguard, it made him also lord commander, i guess), like Cole.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard . . . and when Mormont\\'s gruff counsel and the omens agreed, her course was clear. \\n\\nCole\\'s eye and hair color was a sign that he would be on both sides. Remember, Jorah\\'s family sigil is a **black** bear on top of **green** background and he wears green clothes. (The Asoiaf wiki says he has a black beard, but I\\'ve never seen it write in books.)\\n\\n*So, Jorah will be side the first blacks in this battle. He\\'s in love with Dany and wants to stand by her. But then something will happen, and Jorah will be hostile to Dany and will be side the greens.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n* **Causes of Betrayal**\\n\\nMany scenarios can be produced for this. Like Cole, Dany didn\\'t answer Jorah\\'s love, but I don\\'t give that much chance because I think he already knows Dany never lover him like that, he is not stupid. Even though he was exiled, he still strives to be with her.\\n\\nThe possibility in my mind is \"home\" and \"family\".\\n\\nJorah has a home wound as much as a love wound. He told her this much. Even Dany wondered.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt; \"I am going to take you **home** one day, Missandei,\" Dany promised. If I had made the same promise to **Jorah**, would he still have sold me? \"I swear it.\" \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe know Dany will be corrupt by power. We also know that her actions will be a bit extreme. Dany\\'s revenge list also includes the north. I believe she could turn into a Maegor-Viserys mix. \\n\\n&gt; She lifted her head. \"And I am Daenerys Stormborn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and **Maegor the Cruel** and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\\'s daughter, and I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\" \\n\\n I believe it is a FS. Dany became Aegon the Conqueror, she was Aegon the Conqueror with teats. Later she will became Maegor the Cruel with teats. Rae was even called by that name when she took KL. \\n\\nSo, Her actions may become unacceptable to Jorah after some point. Especially if Dany starts posing a threat to his family ...his home... Jorah can change sides for this reason. After all, everyone has a limit. Even if Jorah is in love with her, he\\'s not going to trade his family\\'s life and home for her.\\n\\nI hate to refer to the show as a reference, but for example ... Jon was in love with her but he killed her anyway because to save his family and home. Why shouldn\\'t Jorah change sides?\\n\\nIn short, the “love” of the three betrayals seems to be very suitable for Jorah. What do you say?',\n",

North of that is a hidden vale called Thenn. And north of that, well, north of that is the Other-controlled Lands Of Always Winter. \\n\\nLet’s just make something clear. Planetos is spherical (Sorry Flat-Earthers!). So, as far north as you go, you have to come down at some point. Eventually a sailor would reach magnetic poles, or another continent. This continent could be new (Northos seems to fit the theme) or it could be Sothoryos (see, a pattern), or potentially Ulthos (where the fuck did that come from!). \\n\\nSo, here comes the BIG REVEAL. Westeros extends from the equator of Planetos (Dorne’s weather patterns seem to do the trick), all the way to the North Pole, meaning Westeros is half of Planetos, top/bottom. \\n\\nTHATS A BIGGGGGG CONTINENT!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nThen at the North Pole, Westeros is connected to Sothoryos or Ulthos* via isthmus. So Westeros is actually bigger than one continent. Extends almost to the equator. PANGAEA TYPE SHIT! \\n\\n*GRRM makes some weird names for his continents. \\n\\nTL;DR: WESTEROS AND SOTHORYOS/ULTHOS MAKE PANGAEA TYPE THINGY',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I know this argument has been made before, but I think it is sometimes dismissed to easily. I\\'m gonna lay out my evidence from the weakest to strongest and from the least to most poetic.\\n\\n1. They look like Targaryans. I may be wrong about this first one, but I believe we are never really told that any Lannisters are that beautiful. In fact, we are never told anyone is beautiful in quite the over the top, in-your-face way we are constantly reminded of the Targaryens, except, of course, with Jaime and Cersei. We certainly don\\'t hear that Tywin was ever that good looking, I don\\'t know about Joanna. Besides, Cersei certainly has a type. She likes Raegar, Aurane Waters b/c he looks Targaryen, and of course Jaime. I\\'m skimming the early chapters of AGOT now and it looks like the first person to see Jaime is Jon Snow. Curiously, he is not in the previous Eddard chapter where everyone arrives. I think this was so that we could specifically get a certain line the *first* time we see Jaime. Jon Snow looks at him and his first thought is: \"*This is what a king should look like.\"* And what exactly should a king (of Westeros) look like. A Targaryen of course.\\n2. Incest. Harder to find a more blatant signal for GRRM to give us then to make them insectuous and *every* time they are called out on it Cersei mentions that the Targaryens wed brother to sister for hundreds of years to keep bloodlines pure.\\n3. Madness. The gods flipped a coin, one is mad, the other isn\\'t. When we are inside Cersei\\'s head, doesn\\'t it feel like this is what it would be like in the mad king\\'s thoughts? Paranoia about plots everywhere, wildfire, incest, rape (with Taena). Also, I know they imply that the madness is from incest, but I don\\'t think incest actually causes madness, it emphasizes traits already extant within a family, so just Tywin and Joanna being cousins I don\\'t think is as good an explanation. Targaryens have a madness in them, emphasized by incest (the association of madness and prophecy might explain why they do interbeed, maybe intentionally playing up the \"madness\"), but it is still a Targaryen quality, not a general incest quality.\\n4. Now we are getting into reasons I think it just makes good storytelling. Firstly, as I said in 3, Cersei essentially replaying her \"father\\'s\" role is nice and poetic. She may well light up the wildfire he placed around the city, carried off by the same madness.\\n5. Arys mistreats Jaime because he hates Tywin, unaware that he was in fact mistreating his own son.\\n6. Jaime unknowingly kills his own father. GRRM *loves* this stuff, probably most famously with Theon and his possible sons, but also Gendry almost sleeping with his probably half sister, and I\\'m sure there is more. It would be truly poetic if Jaime\\'s greatest act was not only king slaying but kin slaying, not to mention the perfect symmetry with Tyrion. Each half brother killing his own father after being tormented by him. Plus, the torn loyalty Jaime has between duty to king and father, turns out there was no difference between the two. It\\'s all good.\\n7. Targaryens are back on the throne. After *all that*. All that war and rebellion twice over devastating the kingdom, children who genetically are essentially the offspring of Arys Targaryen are both the kings and the regent of this kingdom. Not only that, but Joffrey when he was king, and Cersei are likely imbued with the same madness that forced them to drive Arys out. What\\'s more, Robert, who yes specifically hated Raegar but also hated all Targaryens, married a Targaryen, was cuckolded by another, and has children who are half Targaryens to whom he leaves his kingdom.\\n8. You could honestly throw all the previous ones away, this one might be enough to convince me. It is too poetic for Tywin\\'s favorite children to be Arys\\'s and his hated child to be his. The idea that the man *obsessed* with family, legacy, etc. spends the bulk of the story - the bulk of his life - actively wrenching his legacy away from his only trueborn son and handing it over to the children of a man he hated is awesome. The idea that he is seduced by the surface level beauty of the Targaryens, of Arys specifically, reflected in Jaime and Cersei and is repulsed by his own reflection in the twisted little dwarf is too good. This is a story, a constructed world, in which the things that happen are designed with one purpose, to entertain us. Tyrion is one of the most important characters and his relationship with his father is probably his most important relationship. That his father hated him, and maybe that he hated him precisely because he was his own son and a reflection of his own flaws on full display, but loved other children that were not his because he was too blind, too shallow, too obsessed with his own sense of himself as a father to perfect beautiful knights and future queens... the dramatic irony here is too much. This is also why I kind of hate the theory that Tyrion is a secret Targaryen. Dragon dreams or not, it just destroys the most important part of his story, that he is rejected by his own father. If it turns out the man who rejected him is not his real father, that might make for a feel good reveal in a more happy story, but this is ice and fire, Tyrion is not going to get that reveal. He is going to get the knife twisted deeper and deeper. Not only did your father reject you, you were literally all he had, you were so twisted that he couldn\\'t even see that you were his only child, so twisted that, combined with the beauty of your siblings, it literally made him throw out his own legacy and give it to the children of his enemy rather than let you, his own son, have it. How does that knife feel Tyrion? HOW?\\n\\nAnd that is why Jaime and Cersei are Arys\\'s children and Tyrion is definitely *not.* And that is why if you disagree, you are, I am ashamed to say, a poopyhead.\\n\\n(I\\'m writing this near midnight and I\\'m going to bed, but I\\'ll be back to defend my honor in the morning, unless things get too busy at work, I think I\\'ll be here though.)',\n",

But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. **The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching**, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore. \"How did you get this patterning? I\\'ve never seen anything like it.\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"Nor I, my lord,\" said the armorer. \"I confess, these colors were not what I intended, and I do not know that I could duplicate them. Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House, and it was that color I set out to infuse into the metal. But Valyrian steel is stubborn. **These old swords remember, it is said**, and they do not change easily. I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, **but always the color would darken, as if the blade was drinking the sun from it**. And **some folds would not take the red at all**, as you can see.\"\\n\\nI really enjoy the symbolism of Ned\\'s grey sword overpowering and outright rejecting Lannister crimson. The North remembers, and so does Ned\\'s sword!',\n",
